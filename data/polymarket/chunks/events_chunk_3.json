        "description": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if a deal in which Ukraine agrees to formally recognize Russian sovereignty over any UN-recognized Ukrainian territory is reached between the Russian Federation and Ukraine by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThe deal must be a publicly announced mutual agreement. \n\nIf such an agreement is officially reached before the resolution date, this market will resolve to \"Yes\", regardless of if/when the agreement goes into effect.\n\nAn agreement by Ukraine formally recognizing Russian sovereignty over any UN-recognized Ukrainian territory for any amount of time will count.\n\nAn agreement by Ukraine formally recognizing Russian sovereignty over any UN-recognized Ukrainian territory as a precondition of a more comprehensive peace process or deal will qualify, even if the agreement is not finalized or part of a formalized peace deal. The September 8, 1995, \u201cAgreed Basic Principles\u201d between Bosnia and Yugoslavia, which recognized the borders and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and was later formalized through the Dayton Peace Agreement, is an example of a qualifying agreement.\n\nAn official unilateral pledge by Ukraine formally recognizing Russian sovereignty over any UN-recognized Ukrainian territory will qualify for a \u201cYes\u201d resolution even if not part of an agreement with Russia.\n\nThe April 19, 2013, Brussels Agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, in which Serbia recognized Kosovo\u2019s de facto administration but did not formally grant de jure recognition, would not be considered a qualifying agreement under this market, as this market requires formal recognition of sovereignty rather than acknowledgment of administrative control.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be an official announcement by Ukraine and/or the Russian Federation, however, an overwhelming consensus of credible reporting confirming an agreement has been reached will also qualify.\n",

        "description": "This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, if Donald Trump\u2019s disapproval rating on FiveThirtyEight is higher than his approval rating for any date between February 6 and March 31, 2025. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s disapproval rating must be higher than his approval rating, ties will not qualify.\n\nThe approval/disapproval ratings for each date will be considered finalized once the next data point is available. If data for any date remains unavailable, the nearest previous approval/disapproval figures will be used.\n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's rating poll aggregator, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/donald-trump/, specifically the disapproval rating indicated by the purple \"disapprove\", and the green \u201capprove\u201d trend line for the resolution date. The box that 538 uses to calculate the difference using different precision is not relevant for this market - only the difference between approval and disapproval ratings that they report up to one decimal point is considered.\n\nChanges in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the disapproval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThis market may only resolve to \"No\" once the first data point after March 31, 2025 is published. If the first data point after March 31, 2025 is published, and there is still no data point for March 31, this market will resolve according to all prior data points.\n\nPlease note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.",

Any form of informal, unratified, or verbal agreement will not be considered an official ceasefire. The ceasefire must last at least 24 hours and have begun before the resolution date. For example, if the ceasefire begins on August 31, this market would resolve to \"Yes\" if the ceasefire continues for 24 hours.\n\nThis market's resolution will be based on official government announcements from both Israel and Hamas, or reports from credible media sources.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's 2024 presidential election forecast when \"Win probability\" is selected, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/, specifically the numbers indicated by the blue trend line for this market's resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates its figures will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThis market will resolve according to the datapoint for October 11 as soon as the next datapoint become available. This market may not resolve until the next datapoint is available. If no datapoint for October 11 is available by October 14, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous figures to October 11.\n\nPlease note the resolution refers to the odds of Kamala Harris winning as a number out of 100 reported to the 1 digit mark (eg. \"Harris 57 times out of 100\"). The listed number of simulations out of 1,000 will NOT be considered.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOnly individuals arrested in direct connection to the attack will qualify. Arrests of suspected accomplices who did not directly participate in the planting of these explosives will not count. Actions such as questioning or detention without a formal arrest will not qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nIf an arrest is made, this market may remain open beyond the end date in order to confirm whether the arrested individual qualifies according to the rules.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official information from law enforcement agencies, however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAs they stand on February 21, qualifying charges are:\nFederal - Murder through use of a firearm\nState - Murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree as a crime of terrorism, murder in the second degree\n\nIf all of these charges are dropped or dismissed, or otherwise changed to charges that involve neither murder, manslaughter, nor terrorism, this market will resolve to \"No\". If there is a mistrial, this market will stay open to consider further retrials, only resolving once this market's resolution date has passed.\n\nIf a verdict is reached on all named charges, this market will immediately resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market is the ruling court in this case, however a consensus of credible reporting will also be used.",
