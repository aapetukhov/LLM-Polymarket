If a ban is announced, this market will remain open until the first round of the election, in order to allow for any reversals of the ban.\n\nAny changes to Georgescu\u2019s eligibility after the first round of voting will not be considered.\n\nIf Georgescu decides not to participate, without having been formally banned, it will not be considered for this market - he must be legally prohibited for this market to resolve to \u201cYes\u201d.\n\nIf the first round of the Romanian presidential election does not begin by June 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source will be official announcements from the government of Romania (including courts or election authorities) or a consensus of credible reporting.\n",

Otherwise, it will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the FOMC\u2019s statement after its meeting scheduled for September 17 - 18, 2024 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the FOMC\u2019s statement for their September meeting with relevant data is issued.

An announcement of a negotiated settlement which gives Russia de jure control will not qualify.

Inflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the index increased by more than 0.1 percent (on a seasonally adjusted basis) from April to May 2024 and \u201cNo\u201c otherwise.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS May 2024 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled to be released on June 12, 2024, at 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.2%, the market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, if it is 0.1%, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d).",
