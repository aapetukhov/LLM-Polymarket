Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No.\" \n\nThe endorsement must be a distinct declaration of support for Biden\u2019s Presidential candidacy. Indirect statements of support, such as retweets, shares of other people's endorsements, or general expressions of admiration, will not count as endorsements.\n\n\"at the 2024 Super Bowl\" means that if Swift endorses Biden on the day of the Super Bowl at its venue, including before/after the game, this market will resolve to \"Yes.\" If it is clear that Taylor Swift left the venue without giving an endorsement, this market may immediately resolve to \"No.\" If the 2024 Super Bowl is cancelled or otherwise does not occur before the 2024 election, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.",

Only announcements of official agreements or actions (e.g. executive order, signed legislation, etc.) will count - mere posts on Social Media will not.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official information from the governments of the US, Greenland, and Denmark , however a consensus of credible reporting confirming that Greenland has come under U.S. sovereignty will also qualify.",

The service will allow users to, among other things, secure funding for their X Wallets, perform P2P payments, and transfer funds to their bank accounts. You can read more about that here: https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/x-partners-with-visa-to-launch-x-money-later-this-year/3464796\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if X launches 'X Money' between January 27 and December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf 'X Money' is made publicly available for a majority of US users exclusively through purchase or X premium it will be sufficient to resolve this market to \"Yes\". Limited betas will not qualify.\n\nThe feature does not have to be titled 'X Money' for this market to resolve to \"Yes\" so long as the feature provides one or more of the named services.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from X, however a consensus of credible reporting will also be used.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nHarris's favorable rating must be higher than her unfavorable rating, ties will not qualify.\n\nThe favorability ratings for each day must be finalized before they are considered for this market (namely once the next data point is available, the previous one is finalized).\n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's rating poll aggregator, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/kamala-harris/, specifically the favorability rating indicated by the purple \"favorable\" trend line for the resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the favorability rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThis market may only resolve to \"No\" once the first data point after September 13, 2024 is published. If no such data point is available by September 20, 2024, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPlease note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.",

However, if Biden begins correcting the name before he has completed saying the incorrect name, and completes a full pronunciation correctly, it will not count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nIf the debate is canceled or rescheduled to a date later than June 27, 2024 ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source will be video footage of the debate.\n",

Only announcements of official agreements or actions (e.g. executive order, signed legislation, etc.) will count - mere posts on Social Media will not.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official information from the governments of the US, Greenland, and Denmark , however a consensus of credible reporting confirming that Greenland has come under U.S. sovereignty will also qualify.
