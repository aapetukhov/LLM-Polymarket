This market will resolve to \u201cTrump\u201d if Donald Trump is the favorite to win.\n\nThe favorite to win one week after the debate will be determined by looking at the 4 hour time window seven days after the debate (which is currently September 17), between 12 PM ET and 4 PM ET. This market will resolve to whichever candidate is ahead more than the other during this period.\n\nThe resolution source will be a comparison between the charts for each candidate found at https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024 when the \u201c6H\u201d option is selected and decimals are turned on (settings icon -> Decimals toggled on). If the debate is postponed, the rules will apply to the date one week after the first debate. If no debate occurs before the election, this market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThe relevant data points will be those each minute during 12 PM ET to 4 PM ET (i.e. 12:00, 12:01 up to 3:59 PM ET) for each of the candidates. Each of these data points will be compared minute-by-minute, and this market will resolve to whichever candidate is ahead more than the other. For example if they are tied in 160 data points, Trump is ahead in 60 data points, and Harris is ahead in 20 data points, this market would resolve to \"Trump.\"",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nNote that the approval ratings for each day must be finalized before they are considered for this market (namely once the next data point is available, the previous one is finalized). \n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's approval rating poll aggregator, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/, specifically the approval rating indicated by the green trend line for the resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nPlease note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc).

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nNote that the approval ratings for each day must be finalized before they are considered for this market (namely once the next data point is available, the previous one is finalized). \n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's approval rating poll aggregator, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/, specifically the approval rating indicated by the green trend line for the resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nPlease note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.",

Participation in a combat role is necessary for this market to resolve to \"Yes\" (e.g. military personnel providing training or intelligence support would not qualify toward a \"Yes\" resolution, however drone pilots or infantry directly attacking Russian troops, or soldiers targeting and downing missiles from Ukrainian soil would qualify toward a \"Yes\" resolution).\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from NATO, the EU, or member states of either entity, however a consensus of credible reporting will also be used.",

        "description": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Joe Biden calls someone by an incorrect name or references the wrong person at any point during his main keynote speech during the 2024 Democratic National Convention. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nBiden will be considered to have gotten a name wrong if he addresses or refers to an individual using a name that is not their correct or commonly known name. This includes, but is not limited to, using a wrong first or last name, a nickname which is not associated with the person, or any mispronunciation that significantly alters the intended name (e.g. when Biden referred to Rishi Sunak as \u2018Mr. Sanook\u2019 this would qualify for a \u201cYes\u201d see:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm9IjiwJxAo).\n\nIf Biden says a person's name correctly but associates it with incorrect events or a different identity, this will also be sufficient to resolve the market to \"Yes\" (e.g. Biden says Andrew Tate is the current President of France).\n\nIf Biden corrects himself after using an incorrect name, it will still qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. However, if Biden begins correcting the name before he has completed saying the incorrect name, and completes a full pronunciation correctly, it will not count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nIf Biden does not give a keynote speech before the end of the DNC, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source will be video footage of the speech.",

Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.2%, the market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, if it is 0.1%, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d).",

        "description": "This is a market on the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate (total unemployed, as percent of the civilian labor force, official unemployment rate denoted as U-3) reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Employment Situation Report for October 2024.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the Monthly Employment Situation Report, published by the BLS every month at https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/empsit.htm, specifically the U-3 measure in the Table A-15 for the month in question.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, if the seasonally adjusted U-3 unemployment rate in the United States for October 2024 is more than 4.1%, otherwise it will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThe next data release is scheduled for November 1, 2024, 8:30 AM ET. This market will resolve as soon as the relevant data is issued. Any revisions to the data after the first release will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market reports unemployment to one decimal point. Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if unemployment is 4.2%, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, if it is 4.1%, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d).\n",

Inflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the index increased by more than 0.0 percent (on a seasonally adjusted basis) from May to June 2024 and \u201cNo\u201c otherwise.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS June 2024 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled to be released on July 11, 2024, at 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.1%, the market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, if it is 0.0%, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d).",

This market will resolve to whichever candidate is ahead more than the other during this period.\n\nThe resolution source will be a comparison between the charts for each candidate found at\u00a0https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024\u00a0when the \u201c6H\u201d option is selected and decimals are turned on (settings icon -> Decimals toggled on). \n\nThe relevant data points will be those each minute during 12 PM ET to 3 PM ET (i.e. 12:00, 12:01 up to 2:59 PM ET) for each of the candidates. Each of these data points will be compared minute-by-minute, and this market will resolve to whichever candidate is ahead more than the other. For example if they are tied in 100 data points, Trump is ahead in 60 data points, and Harris is ahead in 20 data points, this market would resolve to \"Trump.\"",
