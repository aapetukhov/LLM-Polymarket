Iran promised a \"decisive response\".\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if there is an Iranian response to Israel's bombing of the Iranian consulate in Syria by April 8, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise this market will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nA response by Iran refers to action(s) carried out by Iran that are explicitly in response to Israel's bombing of the Iranian consulate in Syria, which may include strikes, cyber attacks, sanctions, etc.\n\nOnly responses by Iranian forces explicitly claimed by the Islamic Republic of Iran will count toward the resolution of this market. Attacks on Israel by proxy forces (i.e.  Hezbollah, Houthis, etc.) will not count toward the resolution of this market.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nSuch a bill must apply to US taxpaying persons in general; if a law applies only to specific companies or institutions, it will not qualify toward a \"Yes\" resolution to this market.\n\nIf capital gains is eliminated only for specific types or classes of crypto assets (e.g., only Bitcoin or Ethereum, only American issued cryptocurrencies, or only NFTs), it will still count toward a \"Yes\" resolution for this market.\n\nIf the bill is signed into law, or executive action is instituted before the resolution date, it will suffice to resolve this market to \"Yes\" regardless of when it takes effect.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the US federal government, however a consensus of credible reporting will also be used.",

        "description": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if US President-elect Donald Trump issues a public statement about the current immigration debate surrounding skilled, legal foreign workers between December 26, 2024, 2:00 PM ET and December 27, 2024, 11:59 PM ET (see https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1871978282289082585). Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nQualifying statements must be issued by Trump, his social media accounts, or statements made to media outlets. Trump does not need to explicitly mention the H-1B visa so long as it's clear a statement references the ongoing debate about skilled, legal foreign worker immigration vs. American workers (see tweets such as https://x.com/NikkiHaley/status/1872344248915554712, https://x.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1872312139945234507, https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1871956518213656728, etc.). Statements solely about illegal immigration (e.g. via southern border) will not count.\n\nFor the purposes of this market, a public statement includes any social media post (e.g. via https://x.com/potus) or public statements (e.g. a comment to the press, a speech given at an event).\n\nThe primary resolution source will be the qualifying statement itself, however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.",
