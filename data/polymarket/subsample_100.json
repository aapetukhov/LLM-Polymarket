Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purpose of this market's resolution, any detonation of a nuclear weapon anywhere on the planet Earth will be sufficient to trigger a \"Yes\" resolution. This includes offensive usages, nuclear tests, and accidental detonations. \n\nUse/launch of a nuclear weapon that fails to detonate, a fake weapon that never detonates, or a dirty bomb that distributes radioactive material by means of a conventional explosion are not sufficient to trigger a \"Yes\" resolution of this market. Only a successful nuclear detonation will result in a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThis market may resolve to \"Yes\" as soon as a nuclear detonation is confirmed by a preponderance of credible reporting.\n\nFor the purpose of this market's resolution, determination as to whether a detonation was nuclear will be made by a preponderance of credible reporting.\n",

Inflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if the index increased by more than 0.0 percent (on a seasonally adjusted basis) from May to June 2024 and “No“ otherwise.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS June 2024 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled to be released on July 11, 2024, at 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.1%, the market will resolve to “Yes”, if it is 0.0%, this market will resolve to “No”).",

Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates its figures will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThis market will resolve according to the datapoint for September 6 as soon as datapoint for September 7 become available.
