Amazon announced Thursday, April 11, 2024, that it added artificial intelligence visionary Andrew Ng to its board of directors amid intense AI competition among startups and big technology companies. Credit: AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File\n\nAmazon is adding artificial intelligence visionary Andrew Ng to its board of directors, a move that comes amid intense AI competition among startups and big technology companies.\n\nThe Seattle company said Thursday that Ng, a managing director at the Palo Alto, California-based AI Fund, will replace a seat vacated by Judy McGrath, a former CEO of MTV who told Amazon she won't run for reelection.\n\nNg's AI Fund, which he founded in 2017, invests in entrepreneurs building artificial intelligence companies. Previously, he led AI teams at the Chinese tech company Baidu and Google, where the team he oversaw taught a computer system to recognize cats in YouTube videos without ever being taught what a cat was.\n\nNg's addition to the board comes as Amazon, like other tech companies, makes massive investments in generative artificial intelligence. The company has invested $4 billion in the San Francisco-based startup Anthropic, which is partnering with Amazon to develop so-called foundation models that underpin generative AI technologies. In the past year, Amazon also rolled out a chatbot for businesses called Q and a generative-AI powered shopping assistant named Rufus.\n\nIn an annual shareholder letter released Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy suggested generative AI could be the next big pillar of Amazon's business, joining the company's prominent online marketplace, Prime subscription program and its cloud computing unit, AWS. Jassy wrote that generative AI may be the largest technological transformation since cloud computing, and \"perhaps since the internet.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other Amazon innovations have encountered some hiccups. The company said last week it was pulling its Just Walk Out technology from Amazon Fresh stores in the U.S. after receiving some customer feedback. Amazon said it was replacing the technology, which allows customers to skip the checkout line, with smart carts that would allow them still to do that but also see their spending in real time.\n\n© 2024 The Associated Press.

Microsoft, Apple and NVIDIA are the only three companies in the world to have crossed the $3 trillion mark so far.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStrategic cost-cutting and restructuring moves, along with the focus on AI, have also boosted investor confidence.\n\n\n\n'AI-fication' of Alexa\n\nAmazon is planning a major update to its voice assistant, Alexa, to better compete with AI chatbots from Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. This revamp can transform Alexa into a much smarter personal assistant.\n\nThe initiative, known internally as 'Project Banyan,' represents the most significant change to Alexa since its debut in 2014 with the Echo speaker line. The key feature of this overhaul is the integration of conversational generative AI. This technology will enable Alexa to understand and respond to complex prompts and questions in a more human-like manner.\n\nAccording to a report by Reuters, Amazon has named the upgraded assistant \"Remarkable Alexa.\" CEO Andy Jassy has personally invested in the project, setting an internal deadline of August for the new version's release. In an April letter to shareholders, Jassy hinted at these changes, promising a \"more intelligent and capable Alexa.\""

                "text": "Big tech dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative. But one company may be under the radar compared to its peers.\n\nThe euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) is in full swing. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes are trading near record levels, and many on Wall Street are anticipating further gains.\n\nAmong the hottest names in AI are the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- a catchy moniker used to collectively describe megacap behemoths Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Apple, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Amazon (AMZN -0.59%).\n\nMicrosoft and Nvidia have been identified as two early darlings in the AI revolution. But e-commerce and cloud computing leader Amazon has quietly made some notable progress of its own.\n\nBrian Nowak of Morgan Stanley recently raised his price target for Amazon stock to $215 -- implying roughly 15% upside as of market close on April 10.\n\nLet's break down why now could be a terrific opportunity to scoop up shares of Amazon.\n\nCash flow is king\n\nThe last couple of years have been challenging for Amazon. The macroeconomy has been plagued by unusually high inflation, causing the Federal Reserve to enforce a number of aggressive interest rate hikes.\n\nThe combination of lingering inflation and rising borrowing costs had a meaningful impact on both consumers and businesses. As a result, Amazon's e-commerce and cloud software businesses witnessed stalling growth as corporations and consumers reined in spending.\n\nNevertheless, Amazon's management adjusted and proved that the company can thrive even during more daunting economic periods. During 2023, inflation began to cool while artificial intelligence (AI) became all the rage in the tech sector.\n\nAmazon's growth began to accelerate again -- but it was the company's profitability profile that really shined.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon generated a jaw-dropping $36.8 billion in free cash flow, which is what's left over from cash flow after operations expenses and capital spending This is quite a turnaround considering that the year before, Amazon burned $11.6 billion of cash.\n\nThe most encouraging part about Amazon's consistent and compounding cash flow is that it comes from different sides of the company's business.\n\nAmazon buckets its online and physical stores as well as its advertising businesses into geographic categories called North America and International. In 2023, the combined operating income for these segments was $12.2 billion -- a major reversal from a combined operating loss of $10.6 billion in 2022.\n\nBut it was Amazon's cloud business that really helped reignite the company's return to profitability. Sales in Amazon Web Services (AWS) increased 13% year over year in 2023 to $90.6 billion while boasting an impressive 27% operating margin.\n\nAmazon's strong performance in high-growth markets, combined with its robust cash-flow profile, are what make the company stand out among its peers. It's no wonder the company has earned a spot in the portfolios of both Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett.\n\nWhile there was a lot to celebrate in 2023, Amazon isn't resting on its laurels. Savvy investments in artificial intelligence (AI) could be the key to unlock the company's next phase of supercharged growth.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is an enormous opportunity\n\nMicrosoft really kicked off the AI revolution after its investment in OpenAI -- the developer of ChatGPT. The move was the impetus for more aggressive spending in the AI arena from big tech in particular.\n\nAmazon followed Microsoft with its own investment in a competing platform called Anthropic. As part of the deal, Anthropic will use AWS as its primary cloud services provider. This is a huge deal and should not be underestimated. The partnership with Anthropic could spell a new wave of lead generation for AWS and serve as catalyst for accelerated further growth -- on both the top and bottom line.\n\nAdditionally, Anthropic will also be using Amazon's in-house Trainium and Inferentia chips to develop and enhance its generative AI models. This is a subtle opportunity that investors should keep an eye on. For now, the semiconductor market is dominated by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nHowever, Amazon's foray into the chip market could be a lucrative opportunity in the long run as the company seeks to disrupt several facets of the AI realm.\n\nA magnificent valuation\n\nThe chart below benchmarks the Magnificent Seven stocks on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. Amazon's P/S of 3.4 is the lowest among this cohort by wide a margin.\n\nMy take is that Amazon's position within the AI landscape is misunderstood. In contrast to Amazon, there are very few companies that can benefit from artificial intelligence (AI) in multiple ways.\n\nConsidering Amazon's business spans e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising, and streaming, there are a host of ways for the company to apply AI across its ecosystem. This could lead to a new period of exponential growth in both revenue and profits.\n\nGiven Amazon's discounted valuation relative to peers, I think now is a terrific opportunity to scoop up some shares as the secular themes in artificial intelligence (AI) continue to play out."

Amazon announced Thursday, April 11, 2024, that it added artificial intelligence visionary Andrew Ng to its board of directors amid intense AI competition among startups and big technology companies. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)\n\nAmazon is adding artificial intelligence visionary Andrew Ng to its board of directors, a move that comes amid intense AI competition among startups and big technology companies.\n\nThe Seattle company said Thursday that Ng, a managing director at the Palo Alto, California-based AI Fund, will replace a seat vacated by Judy McGrath, a former CEO of MTV who told Amazon she won't run for reelection.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nNg's AI Fund, which he founded in 2017, invests in entrepreneurs building artificial intelligence companies. Previously, he led AI teams at the Chinese tech company Baidu and Google, where the team he oversaw taught a computer system to recognize cats in YouTube videos without ever being taught what a cat was.\n\nNg's addition to the board comes as Amazon, like other tech companies, makes massive investments in generative artificial intelligence. The company has invested $4 billion in the San Francisco-based startup Anthropic, which is partnering with Amazon to develop so-called foundation models that underpin generative AI technologies. In the past year, Amazon also rolled out a chatbot for businesses called Q and a generative-AI powered shopping assistant named Rufus.\n\nIn an annual shareholder letter released Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy suggested generative AI could be the next big pillar of Amazon's business, joining the company's prominent online marketplace, Prime subscription program and its cloud computing unit, AWS. Jassy wrote that generative AI may be the largest technological transformation since cloud computing, and “perhaps since the internet.”\n\nMeanwhile, other Amazon innovations have encountered some hiccups. The company said last week it was pulling its Just Walk Out technology from Amazon Fresh stores in the U.S. after receiving some customer feedback. Amazon said it was replacing the technology, which allows customers to skip the checkout line, with smart carts that would allow them still to do that but also see their spending in real time."

                "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s newly named cloud chief, Matt Garman, inherits a $100-billion-a-year business that’s as profitable as it has ever been. He also faces the daunting task of retaining the cloud-computing pioneer’s edge in the artificial intelligence age.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA longtime Amazon Web Services engineering leader who was most recently sales chief, Garman, 48, will assume one of the most prominent positions in the technology industry when he succeeds Adam Selipsky next month.\n\nSelipsky, who has led AWS since 2021, will relinquish the role on June 3 “to move onto his next challenge,” Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said in an email to employees on Tuesday.\n\nThe cloud unit, the world’s largest seller of rented computing power and data storage, has long accounted for most of Amazon’s operating income, serving as a cash machine that gives the parent company flexibility to make big investments in other areas.\n\nBut AWS struggled in the last two years when businesses trimmed their technology spending following pandemic-era splurges. The cloud unit’s growth slowed to a record low last year, which executives attributed in part to Amazon’s own efforts to help customers save money. The unit held its largest-ever layoffs a year ago and has continued trimming since, even as it continues to hire for specific areas.\n\nThe division also stumbled out of the gate in the race to commercialize a new generation of artificial intelligence services, lagging behind rivals Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in bringing to market the systems that power such products as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nEarly versions of AWS’s AI products were deemed insufficient by some customers. Since then, the company has invested $4 billion in Anthropic, a well-regarded builder of generative AI tools. AWS is also building its own tools to rival ChatGPT and has partnered with other companies to power AI services with its servers.\n\nSo while Microsoft and Google are widely seen as leaders in generative AI — which responds to users’ prompts with newly created text, voice or images — Amazon expects to reap tens of billions of dollars in AI-related business for years to come.\n\n“Regardless of how much or how little Adam Selipsky is responsible for AWS’s progression in AI, as CEO, he owns the outcome,” said Corey Quinn, the chief cloud economist at the Duckbill Group, a consulting firm that advises AWS clients. “And the outcome has not been terrific.”\n\nStory Continues"

This U.S.-Japan academic partnership is part of a broad, $110 million effort to build upon the strong ties between the U.S. and Japan and to continue to lead innovation and technological breakthroughs in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe groundbreaking agreement involving universities and industry leaders in both countries was announced on April 9th in Washington, D.C. as part of Prime Minister Kishida Fumio’s historic state visit. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, and Japanese Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Moriyama Masahito announced two new research partnerships in artificial intelligence between the University of Washington and the University of Tsukuba and between Carnegie Mellon University and Keio University. These partnerships are supported by $110 million in combined private sector investment from NVIDIA, Amazon, Arm, Microsoft, and nine Japanese companies. Amazon and NVIDIA will each invest $25 million in this collaboration.\n\n“This is an extraordinary opportunity for the UW to lead the global conversation on AI and to convene academic researchers, industry experts and governmental leaders to not only advance the workforce, but to change lives and communities by leveraging this powerful technology,” said UW Provost Tricia Serio.\n\n“This is an exciting effort that brings together the talents and expertise of cutting-edge, world-class universities,” said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. “Advancements in AI are happening at a breakneck pace. This collaboration will help provide the research and workforce training for our regions’ tech sectors to keep up with the profound impacts AI is having across every sector of our economy.”\n\nAt the invitation of Ambassador Emanuel, the UW has been forging ties with the University of Tsukuba over the past year, with a focus on shared expertise in artificial intelligence. Tsukuba is known in Japan for being at the center of scientific research and innovation, much like Seattle’s reputation for fostering technological breakthroughs and being home to some of the world’s biggest technology companies.\n\n“We are honored to work with Amazon and NVIDIA as well as with the University of Tsukuba to advance artificial intelligence and global engagement,” said Nancy Allbritton, dean of the College of Engineering. “Tsukuba is a science city just as Seattle is, and we see a tremendous opportunity to leverage the university and the whole ecosystem to create a better future on both sides of the Pacific. We are grateful to Ambassador Emanuel for catalyzing this landmark partnership.”\n\nFaculty and staff from the College of Engineering will spearhead UW interdisciplinary efforts. This multi-year partnership will feature work in areas where AI can drive transformative change to benefit society, including healthcare, robotics, climate change and atmospheric science, among others. The funding will support research awards, post-doctoral and doctoral students, an undergraduate summer research program, and an entrepreneurship bootcamp program.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is the third strategic university-corporate partnership initiative concluded between American and Japanese academic institutions and the corporate sector since May 2022, when President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Kishida made a commitment to advance U.S.-Japan science and technology cooperation. The UW also is the lead partner on UPWARDS, a program focused on workforce development for the semiconductor industry supported by Micron, Tokyo Electron Limited and the National Science Foundation."

                "text": "LONDON (AP) — British competition regulators said Wednesday they'll scrutinize recent artificial intelligence deals by Microsoft and Amazon over concerns that the moves could thwart competition in the AI industry.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority said it's looking into Microsoft's partnership with France's Mistral AI and the company's hiring of key staff from another startup, Inflection AI. The watchdog also separately announced that it's investigating Amazon's $4 billion investment in San Francisco-based Anthropic.\n\nBig Tech companies have been pouring money into generative AI startups amid growing public and business interest in the technology, but the investments have also drawn attention from antitrust authorities.\n\nThe U.K. watchdog said it was seeking comments from “interested third parties,\" before deciding whether to carry out an in-depth antitrust investigation.\n\n\"We will assess, objectively and impartially, whether each of these three deals fall within U.K. merger rules and, if they do, whether they have any impact on competition in the U.K.,\" the watchdog’s executive director of mergers, Joel Bamford, said in a statement.\n\nMicrosoft said it will provide the watchdog with the information it needs to carry out its inquiries.\n\n“We remain confident that common business practices such as the hiring of talent or making a fractional investment in an AI start-up promote competition and are not the same as a merger, the company said.\n\nMicrosoft last month hired Mustafa Suleyman, who co-founded Google’s DeepMind AI research lab, to head up its consumer artificial intelligence business, along with the chief scientist and several top engineers and researchers from Inflection, his AI startup.\n\nMicrosoft also teamed up earlier this year with Mistral, which has become France's AI darling after being founded only last year. That followed Microsoft's previous existing partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is also facing scrutiny from the CMA.\n\nMistral said it's “fully committed to cooperating with the CMA throughout this process to ensure that our long-term independence and access to the market are upheld.”\n\nAmazon, meanwhile, has spent billions for a minority stake in Anthropic. The two companies are collaborating to develop so-called foundation models, which underpin the generative AI systems that have captured global attention.\n\n“It's unprecedented for the CMA to review a collaboration of this type,” Amazon said in a statement. “Unlike partnerships between other AI startups and large technology companies, our collaboration with Anthropic includes a limited investment, doesn’t give Amazon a board director or observer role, and continues to have Anthropic running its models on multiple cloud providers.”\n\nThe CMA said it's stepping up its scrutiny of the market for foundation models after it published a report that highlighted the risk that powerful companies could use partnerships with key AI players to strengthen their positions.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But there’s a catch. Siri only works with the speakers if you also have a HomePod or HomePod mini speaker to act as a relay.\n\nThe same is true of the first non-Apple products that added Apple, ecobee smart thermostats. But it’s a little weirder this time because it’s all speakers. Only an Apple speaker will let you use Siri with Denon’s speakers.\n\nThis post contains affiliate links. Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items.\n\nDenon speakers work with Siri voice assistant now (but you also need a HomePod or HomePod mini)\n\nDenon became the second company to add support for the Siri voice assistant to a product line after ecobee did it with a pair of smart thermostats in May 2022, HomeKit News & Reviews reported. The same need for a HomePod or a HomePod applied to using Siri with the ecobee products.\n\nSo why is that? Well, Siri only works on Apple devices and isn’t installed on third-party devices. With Siri, all of the processing for requests has to happen on an Apple device. Functionality added to third-party products really just communicates with the Apple product to relay information back and forth.\n\nSo that’s useful for interacting with Siri, say, if your Denon speaker(s) and/or soundbar are in one room and your HomePod is elsewhere in the house (with both accessing your Wi-Fi network, of course).\n\nDenon speakers that work with Siri via Denon’s Heos app are the following: Denon Home Series models 150, 250, 350, and the 550 Soundbar, all of which support AirPlay 2.\n\nDenon provides instructions for using Siri with its speakers here. To establish Siri, you’ll need to remove and re-add the the Denon speaker(s) to your Home app.\n\nDenon’s speakers have Amazon Alexa built in, but only one voice assistant works at a time. So establishing Siri will disable Alexa. If rumors of Siri improvements via artificial intelligence come true, maybe that will be worthwhile.\n\nYou can fine Denon speakers like the Home 250 on Amazon."

Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana and CEO of Solana Labs, commented on the launch, stating:\n\nToken extensions build on the characteristics that make Solana the ideal destination for developers. Solana is the first network to offer this level of integrated developer and user experience in a single token program. We’re already seeing the potential to build using token extensions via deployments from some of the most recognizable names in crypto.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Goes To The Doctor: 5 Key Metrics For BTC In 2024 1 year ago\n\nIndustry giants Paxos and GMO-Z.com Trust Company Inc. (GMO Trust) are leading the way in adopting token extensions. As announced by the Solana Foundation, these companies are “leveraging the benefits” of token extensions to issue stablecoins on the Solana blockchain.\n\nAs previously reported, Paxos, a regulated blockchain and tokenization infrastructure platform, expanded its stablecoin issuance to the network in December. Similarly, GMO Trust announced the launch of the first regulated Japanese yen stablecoin and their own US dollar stablecoin on the Solana network.\n\nNew Standards For Blockchain Compliance?\n\nSheraz Shere, Head of Payments at the Solana Foundation, emphasized the appeal of the Solana network for enterprise-grade companies entering the web3 space. Shere stated:\n\nCompanies like Visa, Worldpay, Stripe, Google, and Shopify have already seen the performance advantages inherent to the Solana network and have launched solutions and applications that are only possible on Solana. With token extensions, we are expanding what is possible for enterprise adoption of blockchain by natively enabling features that matter to large regulated enterprises.\n\nToken extensions, designed to cater to builders across diverse industries such as stablecoins, real-world assets (RWA), and payments, offer a range of interesting features:\n\nTransfer Hooks: Enables token issuers to exert control over token interactions, empowering developers to create intricate and flexible token mechanisms.\n\nTransfer Fees: Provides the ability to charge fees for each token transfer, offering sustainable revenue models for different types of tokens built using token extensions.\n\nConfidential Transfers: Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to encrypt the transfer amount while publicly sharing the source, destination, and token type. This ensures compliance while preserving privacy.\n\nPermanent Delegate Authority: Grants token issuers absolute authority over their tokens, particularly for those requiring revocation ability, such as licenses or credentials.\n\nNon-transferability: Restricts token transfers to the issuer only, making it ideal for unique user identification and credentialing purposes.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nUltimately, with the launch of token extensions, Solana aims to position itself as a force in blockchain development, offering builders the tools to create new applications across various industries.\n\nThe SOL token experienced a sharp drop of over 28% in the past 30 days, leading to a decline to the $79 level. However, the token has recovered in the past 24 hours with a 5% bounce, leading to a current trading price of $87.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

This is the largest transfer volume recorded by stablecoins on the Layer-1 blockchain in a single month.\n\nTo put this figure into context, the Solana network registered $297 billion in stablecoin volume in the entire December. Meanwhile, the blockchain’s stablecoin transfer volume was about $11.56 billion in January 2023, reflecting an over 2,500% growth in the past year.\n\nStablecoin transfer volume across various blockchains in the past year | Source: Artemis\n\nRelated Reading\n\nFrom the chart above, it is clear that Solana’s stablecoin activity has been on a steady rise since October, increasing by more than 650% in the past few months. This growth has also impacted the network’s share in the stablecoin market, with Solana now boasting about 32% market share.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Ethereum leads the market for stablecoins, with its transfer volume already reaching almost $317 billion in January. Meanwhile, the Tron network trails Solana in third place, with a stablecoin volume of roughly $240 billion.\n\nOn Thursday, January 18, Paxos revealed the launch of its regulated stablecoin, USDP, on the Solana network. According to DefiLlama data, USDC remains the dominant stablecoin on the Layer-1 network, with a market cap of over $1 billion.\n\nPaxos is thrilled to share our regulated stablecoin USDP is now live on the @solana blockchain!

As of this writing, the Solana token is valued at $92, reflecting a 0.6% decline in the last 24 hours.\n\nThis sluggish performance in the past day underscores the altcoin’s challenges since the turn of the year. After reaching a multi-month high of $124 at the end of 2023, the SOL price has largely struggled to hold above the $100 mark.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, the Solana token is down by more than 5% in the past week. Meanwhile, the coin has declined by about double that figure since the beginning of 2024.\n\nNevertheless, SOL maintains its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the sector, with a market capitalization of more than $40 billion.\n\nSolana price faces downward pressure on the daily timeframe | Source: SOLUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Dreamstime/Aivaras Sakurovas, chart from TradingView"

However, WIF is still down from its all-time-high of $0.46, which it hit on January 18.

Newly listed pairs in this zone are subject to a 60-day valuation period, and those that fail to meet certain criteria, such as market depth, may be delisted.\n\nThe listing on Bitget has propelled WIF to a market capitalization of $332 million. In the past 24 hours, the meme coin has generated an impressive trading volume of $111 million, making it the top 54 cryptocurrency in terms of volume. Fellow Solana memecoin BONK has also experienced gains, rising 7.5% on Wednesday. It is currently ranked 86th, with a market capitalization of $685 million.\n\nMeanwhile, SOL, the native token of the Solana network, has rebounded following a wider market sell-off, gaining 11.5% since Wednesday and trading at $88.50.

                "text": "Crypto YouTuber Jake Gagain has shared his “insane price prediction” for Solana (SOL) as he said that the crypto token will climb to $750. The crypto analyst didn’t stop there as he also provided a timeframe for when this price level would be attained.\n\nSolana Price To Rise To $750 In 2025\n\nGagain said that he expects Solana to hit this price level by 2025 in an X (formerly Twitter) post. In the accompanying video, he outlined several reasons for this bullish sentiment. For the first, he alluded to the fact that the Solana network happens to be “quicker, safer, and much more affordable” than Ethereum.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nHere Are The Reasons Bitcoin Price Could Drop To $37,000 Before The Halving 1 year ago\n\nAccording to him, more users from Ethereum and other networks are likely to migrate to the Solana network as more projects get built on it. This is based on his expectation that Solana will be the “top competitor” for Ethereum in the next bull run. Gagain further asserted that SOL will end up becoming the third largest token by market cap, only behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe second reason why the analyst is bullish on SOL is because of how it has impressively recovered from the FTX scandal. Solana was at the heart of it as the crypto exchange’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), was one of the token’s biggest backers. SOL dropped below $10 as a result of this while being in the middle of a bear market.\n\nHowever, it has recovered nicely since then, climbing above $100 towards the end of last year. That is why Gagain believes that the crypto token could go as far as hitting its all-time high of $260 and surpassing it.\n\nSOL price drops to $95 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nSOL Is Also Making Its Way Into The Traditional Market\n\nJake Gagain also highlighted the fact that Solana was making its way into the traditional market as another reason he was so bullish on SOL. Solana’s entry into the traditional market is said to be happening through its partnerships with notable brands. One of them, which the crypto analyst mentioned, was its partnership with Shopify.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nShiba Inu Whales Eat The Dip: 2.39 Trillion SHIB Make Their Way To Cold Storage 1 year ago\n\nBack when the partnership was confirmed, NewsBTC highlighted how it could help onboard more users into crypto and specifically into the Solana ecosystem. The network was projected to see more activity, considering the number of users Shopify already has.\n\nInterestingly, the number of transactions Solana records daily is another reason why Gagain is most bullish on SOL. Network activity is known to be another factor that can affect a token’s price.\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL is trading at around $95, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com"

This scenario would position SOL to regain its previously lost highs and set its course toward Ali Martinez’s price targets within $150 to $165.\n\nSOL Market Cap Quadruples, DeFi, And NFT Metrics Skyrocket\n\nSolana has showcased remarkable performance during the fourth quarter of 2023, positioning itself as a leader in the crypto market rally, according to a recent report by Messari.\n\nOne of the key achievements for Solana in Q4 was its notable increase in market capitalization. SOL concluded the year with a market cap of $43.8 billion, marking a staggering 423% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth and an astonishing 1,106% year-on-year (YoY) increase.\n\nThis growth propelled SOL to surpass notable tokens such as ADA, USDC, and XRP in market cap, securing the 5th position among all tokens. It is worth noting that Solana began 2023 ranked 17th in market capitalization, highlighting its exponential rise in prominence.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nTop 8 Crypto Trends That Will Dominate The Market In 2024: Analyst 1 year ago\n\nThe Solana network’s decentralized finance (DeFi) Total Value Locked (TVL) also experienced significant growth. Solana’s DeFi TVL increased by 303% QoQ and an impressive 505% YoY, reaching $1.5 billion.\n\nThe report also highlights the notable increase in DeFi volume on the Solana network. The average daily spot DEX volume experienced a staggering 1,116% QoQ growth, reaching $359 million.\n\nAmong the contributors to this growth, Orca accounted for 45% of the Q4 volumes, followed by Raydium with a 29% market share. Phoenix, a fully on-chain central limit order book, stood out by averaging over 9% of the DEX volume market share.\n\nSolana’s influence in the NFT space also saw substantial growth during Q4. The average daily NFT volume increased by 356% QoQ, reaching $4.8 million. Solana’s market share of NFT volume, excluding Bitcoin, grew from 9% to 26% QoQ, demonstrating its increasing significance in the NFT market.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

It's goose time!\n\nCleveland, OH, Jan. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Honk, a SOL memecoin, was launched on January 13th. It experienced incredible price growth, surging from a cap of a few thousand to multimillions in just a few days.\n\nHonk draws inspiration from the famous memes surrounding the Untitled Goose game. Hilarious memes featuring a goose wearing a knife, stealing items, and honking at everything went a few years ago, creating a substantial community of enthusiasts.\n\nIt's worth noting that Honk is the nemesis of Bonk, another meme featuring a dog with a baseball bat. This rivalry extends to the crypto world, as Bonk is also a memecoin on the Solana blockchain with significant market capitalization. The Honk vs. Bonk battle in the meme sphere has now translated into a competition between the two memecoins on the Solana blockchain, adding a humorous touch to the crypto space.\n\n\n\nHowever, $HONK aims to be more than just a part of this rivalry; it aspires to become the Shiba Inu of Solana. Since memecoins became a thing, there have been two major trends: dog tokens, represented by Doge and Shiba Inu, and frog tokens, represented by Pepe the Frog. Given the popularity of geese in memes, Honk could initiate a third phase, making it the ultimate goose meme.\n\nShiba Inu was built as the official rival of Dogecoin. Similarly, we can find a comparable narrative with Honk, placing it as the natural rival of Bonk.\n\nThe project quickly gained momentum, attracting an active community. The Telegram group is growing, and the community remains engaged. As community support played a pivotal role in the success of Shiba Inu, Honk appears to have a promising future.\n\n$HONK is tradable on Raydium and Jupiter, two decentralized exchanges on the Solana network, with no taxes applied to transactions. The project plans to be listed on centralized exchanges in the future for increased visibility and trading options. The team demonstrates extensive connections and experience in the crypto space.\n\nConsidering these factors, Honk seems to be a promising project. Time will tell if it can replicate Shiba's success, and it's important to conduct your research before investing. Trade safely, and may the goose force be with you!\n\nSocials:\n\nWebsite:\n\nTelegram: t/honk_sol\n\nX (Twitter):\n\nDisclaimer: The Honk token is not endorsed by and has no affiliation with House House or Panic, Inc.

                "text": "Investors won't struggle to find reasons to want to own this innovative digital asset.\n\nPutting money to work in the cryptocurrency market is back in style. The industry saw its value double in 2023, so some investors are trying to buy digital tokens that can supercharge their portfolio returns.\n\nLook at Solana (SOL 5.07%). This cryptocurrency skyrocketed 963% last year, and it's currently the fifth most valuable blockchain network in the world.\n\nHowever, Solana remains 67% off its peak price (as of Jan. 25). Does this mean it's a smart idea to buy it on the dip right now?\n\nUnique features\n\nWhen looking at a potential cryptocurrency investment, it's a good idea to figure out what makes a digital token stand out from the tens of thousands that are out there. With this perspective, it's safe to say that Solana is unique.\n\nIt includes functionality for smart contracts. This makes it similar to Ethereum and Cardano, and it opens up Solana to launch decentralized applications. In fact, Solana is in the top 10 on the list of cryptocurrencies with the most active developers, which bodes well for its future when it comes to introducing use cases.\n\nSolana's greatest feature, though, is its incredible speed, with a theoretical throughput of 50,000 transactions per second (TPS). This puts it in the same ballpark as Visa, one of the largest payment networks in the world. In comparison, Ethereum is only able to process about 12 TPS. The way Solana orders its transactions, called a proof-of-history, requires less data. This also makes Solana a top blockchain when it comes to decentralized finance protocols.\n\nIndeed, Solana is making a push in the payments industry. Solana Pay allows merchants and customers to transact directly with each other, using the native SOL token or a stablecoin, to facilitate transactions on the blockchain. With near-zero fees and instant settlement, the hope is that Solana Pay will achieve greater adoption. Integrating with Shopify should help in this regard.\n\nEntering the hardware space\n\nBesides services, Solana is trying to make a splash in the world of hardware. Last April, the Saga smartphone was released with a $1,000 price tag. This is a mobile device developed specifically for users to interact with web3 applications on the Solana network.\n\nRecently, the Saga Chapter 2, which is a cheaper smartphone that costs $450, started taking pre-orders. Solana is trying to target a mass audience, but the project could be canceled if there's weak demand.\n\nThis hardware strategy is interesting. Consumer electronics is typically a very difficult business, and I wonder if there's that much demand for a crypto-specific smartphone. Only 20,000 Saga phones were produced. So it's difficult for me to see people wanting to buy this over an iPhone or top Android devices. But its progress is something to keep close tabs on.\n\nKeep expectations realistic\n\n\n\nIt's still easy to see the favorable characteristics that might make Solana a potential portfolio addition, at least when it comes to your crypto exposure. Should things work out and Solana gain greater adoption, this digital asset could be worth significantly more a decade from now. At least that's what the bull case centers on.\n\nBut investors also need to set realistic expectations. The cryptocurrency industry, despite its enormous returns, is still full of uncertainty as to the ultimate outcome. There's still a meaningful chance that this entire technology won't even exist 10 years from now. Investors need to understand the risk that they are taking if they buy Solana.\n\nAnd although you might have conviction in this cryptocurrency's prospects, it's always good to remember the extreme volatility that you will face. It's not going to be a smooth ride. For those who are bullish, perhaps initiating a tiny position is a smart approach."

                "text": "The talks behind the Paramount and Warner Bros. merger claim that both companies have canceled this supposed deal, with both going their separate ways in their media and entertainment ventures. It also means that the supposed merger of Paramount+ and Max, the companies' respective streaming platforms, will no longer happen and will continue to operate as separate entities.\n\nHowever, Paramount is still open for its sale to other media companies, offering the company's entirety and renowned franchises to others.\n\nParamount, Warner Bros. Cancels Merger Plans\n\nA report from CNBC details the latest development in Paramount and Warner Bros.' plans to merge into one, now seeing a cancelation on its aspirations to be a single entity. According to people familiar with the merger, the deal is off but did not mention any specifics behind what made the merger fall through.\n\nArs Technica said that there are various possible factors behind this deal going south, stating that there may have been regulatory issues for both media conglomerates to combine into one entity. Notably, Warner Bros. is known for its recent merger and purchase of Discovery, and combining it with Paramount would make it the second-largest streaming business in the world next to Netflix.\n\nOn the other hand, debt may also be the reason behind this canceled deal, as Paramount currently owes $14.6 billion in debt, while Warner Bros. has $40 billion.\n\nParamount+, Max No Longer Combining\n\nWith this deal falling through, it also meant that Paramount+ and Max are no longer combining into one streaming umbrella under WBD's Max which also features Discovery's content. Currently, Max has a total of 97.7 million subscribers while Paramount+ has 63 million, and combining both would have made significant wonders for both.\n\nFor now, Paramount+ and Max would remain as separate entities, competing against each other in this industry.\n\nParamount's Platform and Merger\n\nLate last year, the reports behind the plans to sell Paramount to Warner Bros. took shape, with the industry seeing yet another massive acquisition regarding streaming platforms and media conglomerates into one. Both companies engaged in talks that look into streaming dominance moving forward, planning a significant shift towards offering more content on Max.\n\nNational Amusements' Paramount+ is best known for its featured series, the adaptation of Xbox's exclusive franchise into a live-action storytelling of Halo, highly regarded for its iconic story and production. There is also the Star Trek franchise on Paramount+ offering the old and new generation of the renowned space-based drama, featuring iconic arcs and stories.\n\nParamount+ has massive potential in itself, but merging with other streaming platforms may empower more of itself and the platform that will acquire it for expanded content available. However, it would no longer be merging with Warner Bros., also known for its previous merger with Discovery, with its streaming platforms remaining independent and rivals in the industry."

It was also the busiest start to a year since 2018, according to data from LSEG Deals Intelligence.\n\nThe biggest acquisition was Synopsys’ $35 billion purchase of Ansys, its rival Silicon Valley software firm. Other big deals included Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisition of Juniper Networks, a maker of networking gear, for $13.8 billion and a $14.3 billion bid from a former stand-up comedian to buy Paramount, one of America’s biggest entertainment companies.\n\nIn total, $227 billion of M&A deals were announced worldwide last month,"

                "text": "Warner Bros Discovery no longer pursuing Paramount acquisition – CNBC reports\n\nAnother potential mega-merger involving Warner Bros Discovery, this time involving an acquisition of Paramount Global, is not going ahead.\n\nAccording to reports in the US from CNBC talks have been halted on the plans, which first emerged in December.\n\nA separate deal which would see David Ellison’s Skydance acquiring a majority stake in Paramount’s parent company National Amusements, first reported in January, is still potentially in the works and going through due diligence, according to the same sources.\n\nMedia tycoon Byron Allen, a serial bidder but only occasional buyer of media assets, was also said to be lining up a $30bn bid for Paramount Global.\n\nUS-based news outlet Axios, which was first to report the Warner Bros Discovery bid, said WBD president and CEO David Zaslav and Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish had met at the end of last year in New York to discuss a potential deal and WBD had hired bankers to explore the possibility.\n\nFor WBD, the talks are taking place less than two years after it was formed following the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery. Due to the way the transaction was structured (via a Reverse Morris Trust deal), WBD is unable to participate in most major M&A moves for a two-year period. However, that two-year period ends in April.\n\nIn terms of market cap, WBD is around three times as big as Paramount Global, with a market cap of US$28.4bn to Paramount’s US$10.3bn. Both have enacted sweeping lay-offs and restructuring over the past 18 months. Paramount announced another 800 job cuts worldwide in February.\n\nWBD lost 10% of its share price on Friday following publication of its Q4 results.\n\nA deal would have brought together WBD’s assets, which include streamer Max, premium pay TV network HBO, Cartoon Network, Warner Bros Television, CNN and its portfolio of factual networks with Paramount’s portfolio of assets which includes streamer Paramount+, US broadcast network CBS, CBS News, Paramount Television Studios, Nickelodeon, its movie studio and coveted studio lot.\n\nSkydance, meanwhile, is reportedly considering an all-cash bid to acquire a majority stake in National Amusements, the parent company of Paramount Global.\n\nAccording to a report in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Skydance and its investors – which include Ellison’s father Larry, private equity firm RedBird Capital and China’s Tencent – are in talks with National Amusements owner Shari Redstone about a potential deal.\n\nThe WSJ said the deal being discussed would see Skydance acquiring a majority stake in National Amusements and then pursuing a swift follow-up deal to merge Paramount Global with Skydance. It noted that talks remain at an early stage and could come to nothing."

Each weekday, catch up on the 5 most pressing stories to start your morning in 3 minutes or less. Sign Up\n\nTopline:\n\nWith Warner Bros. Discovery soon allowed to make deals again, the entertainment industry is bracing for another surge in merger and acquisitions activity — and what it might mean for the future.\n\n\n\nWhy it matters: Hollywood has, more or less, always had six major studios. Disney’s acquisition of Fox reduced that number to five (although Netflix could today be considered the sixth). But the two-year anniversary of the Discovery-WarnerMedia merger is upon us, and with it, the “no transaction” rule David Zaslav signed upon purchase is set to expire on April 11. That has inspired questions about whether Warner Bros. Discovery could be sold, or whether it would acquire a rival to compete against Netflix.\n\nAt the same time, Paramount might be in play; it has reportedly received a bid to be acquired by Apollo, the private-equity giant. WBD’s efforts to reduce debt from dealmaking led to cutbacks and cost controls. More may be on the way.\n\nEndgame: The Ankler’s Chief Columnist Richard Rushfield predicts that we could be in for another epic chapter of the Streaming Wars (an endgame, perhaps?) and takes a look at what might happen not only for WBD and Paramount, but also Comcast-NBCUniversal and Disney and Apple.\n\nFor more . . . read the full story on The Ankler.\n\nThis story is published in partnership with The Ankler, a paid subscription publication about the entertainment industry.\n\n"

The chief executive of Skydance Media, David Ellison, is exploring an all-cash bid to take over the company by buying its parent, National Amusements.\n\nSkydance Media’s plans to buy National Amusements were revealed by a source familiar with the matter. It was said that Ellison might take control of Paramount Global’s parent firm through financing from the existing investors of Skydance, which include China’s Tencent, RedBird Capital Partners, and The Ellison family.\n\nMerger Upon Completion of the Deal\n\nAccording to Reuters, if the acquisition deal pushes through and succeeds, Ellison may take another step and consolidate Skydance with Paramount Global. Based on the initial reports, the talks of the acquisition between the companies are still very early, so details are still vague at this point.\n\nMoreover, since the negotiations have only started, there is still a high chance that the talks may not result in an actual deal that will see Skydance Media buying National Amusements. It was noted that many companies have been expressing interest in Paramount Global, as a number of them want to acquire Paramount Pictures. This studio boasts an impressive library of great titles, including “The Godfather” and “Star Trek.”\n\nSkydance Media’s Proposal\n\nBNN Breaking reported that Skydance Media’s chief forwarded a proposal indicating that Eliison and his band of investors would acquire a majority stake in National Amusements from Shari Redstone and her family, who owns a significant stake in the entertainment firm.\n\nAside from this information, other specific particulars of the proposed deal were not disclosed. Meanwhile, if the agreement is completed, the combination of Skydance Media and National Amusement will create one of the largest entertainment companies in the industry.\n\nPhoto by: Paramount Website"

Big Tech companies have seen their businesses rebound while smaller players have not.\n\nLinear ad revenue slumped 15% year over year in the quarter, steeper than the 12% drop expected by analysts and also worse than the 14% year-over-year slump seen in the third quarter.\n\nThe company said the drop reflects continued softness in the global advertising market and a 5-percentage-point impact from lower political advertising. Advertising revenue in the quarter was also impacted by the Hollywood strikes.\n\nIn one bright spot, Paramount reported a Q4 direct-to-consumer (DTC) loss of $490 million, narrower than analyst expectations of $534 million and the $575 million loss seen in the year-earlier period. The company reported a $238 million loss in the third quarter.\n\n\"We now expect to reach domestic Paramount+ profitability in 2025,\" Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said in the earnings release.\n\nFull-year direct-to-consumer losses in 2023 came in at $1.66 billion, ahead of the $1.8 billion streaming loss the company reported for full-year 2022 — on par with company expectations.\n\nDirect-to-consumer advertising revenue increased 14% year over year to $526 million.\n\n\"Our disciplined execution and strong content offering drove our results in 2023, as we continue to evolve our business for profitable growth in 2024 and beyond,\" Bakish added. \"Looking ahead, we continue to be focused on maximizing the return on our content investments and scaling streaming, while transforming the cost base of our business.\"\n\nParamount shares traded mostly flat in after-hours trading following the results.\n\nParamount posted revenue of $7.64 billion — a 6% year-over-year decrease, and a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus estimates of $7.89 billion.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share, however, beat expectations of $0.00 to come in at $0.04 — a 50% decrease from the year-ago period.\n\nParamount+ added 4.1 million subscribers in the quarter, beating expectations of a 3.8 million increase. In total, Paramount+ has reached 67.5 million subscribers.\n\nSubscription revenue also grew 43% in the quarter to reach $1.34 billion, driven by subscriber growth and pricing increases for Paramount+. Overall direct-to-consumer revenue totaled $1.87 billion in the quarter, compared to the expected $1.84 billion."

The market capitalization rose to $8.6 billion for the company, up from its prior $7.7 billion market cap.\n\nApollo Global Management, a private equity firm, reportedly reached out to a special board committee at the media conglomerate earlier in March to discuss buyout opportunities or to purchase some of Paramount Global’s assets, such as CBS, Paramount+, Paramount Pictures or the company’s cable networks like MTV and Nickelodeon.\n\nThe Apollo bid follows offers from David Ellison’s Skydance Media as well as Byron Allen, whose offers both arrived in January within a week of each other. Allen’s bid totaled to $30 billion including the assumption of debt under Allen Media Group. The offer outlined company acquisition for $28.58 per each voting share and $21.53 per each non-voting share.\n\nThe private equity firm has an investment history with entertainment companies like CKx, owner of “American Idol,” which it purchased in 2011. It has also previously held stakes in Cox Media Group, Legendary Entertainment, Sirius Satellite Radio, Barnes & Noble and Redbox. Apollo purchased Yahoo Inc. from Verizon in 2021.\n\nIn December 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav held a meeting with Paramount CEO Bob Bakish to discuss a merger of the two companies, but talks stopped in February.

                "text": "Private-equity firm Apollo Global Management has made an $11 billion offer to buy Paramount Global’s film and TV studio, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nThe bid comes as an independent committee of the company’s directors is reviewing another offer from Skydance Media to merge with all of Paramount, which also owns CBS, Nickelodeon and a number of other cable networks.\n\nParamount’s studio has long been an acquisition target. Netflix was among a number of companies that expressed interest over the past few years in buying the studio, which is behind such movies as “Top Gun: Maverick\" and “A Quiet Place,\" according to other people familiar with the situation.\n\nBut Paramount Global’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, and other board members have resisted selling the studio, which they consider the crown jewel of the company. Redstone, who is open to selling Paramount in its entirety, would have to agree to breaking up the company and allowing a sale of the studio to proceed.\n\nApollo’s offer is more than the entire market capitalization of Paramount Global, which is currently around $7.7 billion. While the studio business is attractive, given its vast library and the demand for fresh programming in the streaming industry, Paramount’s TV networks are declining as the cable business contracts.\n\nBloomberg and Axios earlier reported on Apollo’s interest in Paramount.\n\nMeanwhile, Skydance Media, the production company run by David Ellison, has made an offer to buy Paramount parent National Amusements and merge Skydance into Paramount.\n\nRedstone controls National Amusements, which owns almost 80% of the voting shares of Paramount.\n\nThe details of that offer couldn’t be learned. Ellison is the son of billionaire Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, who is expected to help fund any deal.\n\nIn evaluating the offers, Paramount’s directors have to determine whether the deal would be good for all shareholders, not just its controlling shareholder, National Amusements.\n\nIt has been months since news of the Skydance interest in National Amusements first surfaced late last year. So far this year Paramount’s stock has dropped more than 20% and is trading around $11 per share.\n\nParamount has also had discussions with Warner Bros. Discovery about a merger, and has discussed a streaming partnership or joint venture with Comcast, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.\n\nThe daughter of media mogul Sumner Redstone, Shari Redstone reunited the family’s media empire by merging Viacom and CBS in 2019, later renaming the resulting company Paramount Global.\n\nMiriam Gottfried and Laura Cooper contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jessica Toonkel at jessica.toonkel@wsj.com"

                "text": "Max is joining the password sharing crackdown movement, joining Netflix, Disney Plus in Hulu among the best streaming services that won't let you share your password.\n\nThe move was officially announced at Morgan Stanley’s 2024 Technology, Media & Telecom Conference in San Francisco on Monday (March 4) by President of Global Streaming and Games JB Perrette (h/t The Wrap). When officially announcing the impending crackdown, Perrette said \"We think, relative to the scale of our business, it’s a meaningful opportunity.”\n\nMax will begin its password sharing crackdown later this year and then fully roll out the program in 2025. That means you only have a few more months of using someone else's account to watch Max's library of shows and movies.\n\nBad news — password sharing crackdowns work\n\nOf course, Max isn't the first streaming service to engage in a password sharing crackdown. It's actually nearly the last.\n\nJust don't expect this to be the end of password sharing crackdowns. With Peacock and Paramount merger talks ongoing and Paramount Plus eyeing profitability in 2025, it'd be a shock if it isn't next to join in the password sharing crackdown parade.\n\nNetflix kicked off the movement, veering away from a feature of streaming that it had once championed, back in early 2023 with the first major password-sharing crackdown. People were outraged, assumed it was a massive error on Netflix's part and expected subscription numbers to collapse.\n\nAnd then ... they didn't. In fact, it worked brilliantly for Netflix. Netflix reported \"more new subscriptions in the U.S. ... than in any other four-day period\" during the end of May and 6 million new subscribers in Q2 2023. That number grew in Q3, with another 8.8 million subscribers joining the streaming service and Netflix declaring itself \"completely satisfied\" with the password-sharing crackdown.\n\nSo it's no surprise that the other streaming services — all of which are still struggling to turn a profit — are following Netflix's example. Hulu announced its password-sharing crackdown on Feb. 1 and Disney Plus confirmed its password-sharing crackdown a mere six days later. Both password-sharing crackdowns will begin rolling out on March 14.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

Just don't expect this to be the end of password-sharing crackdowns. With Peacock and Paramount merger talks ongoing and Paramount Plus seeking paths to profitability in 2025, it'd be a shock if it isn't next to join in the password-sharing crackdown parade."

Discovery (WBD) and Paramount Global are no longer considering a merger that would have put the Max and Paramount+ streaming services under one corporate umbrella. Per a CNBC report today citing anonymous “people familiar with the matter,\" WBD and Paramount had been mulling a merger for “several months.\"\n\nIn December, reports started swirling about WBD and Paramount discussing a potential merger. Axios even reported that WBD CEO David Zaslav and Paramount CEO Bob Bakish met in person for “several hours” and that Zaslav also met with Shari Redstone, the owner of National Amusements Inc. (NAI), Paramount’s parent company. Now, CNBC reports that discussions between the media giants “cooled off this month.” Paramount and WBD haven’t commented.\n\nWhen news of the potential merger dropped, it was unclear what sort of regulatory hurdles the media conglomerates might have faced if they tried becoming one. Combined, the companies would have had the second-biggest streaming business by subscriber count, trailing Netflix.\n\nDebt was also a huge concern. Paramount is $14.6 billion in debt, per its earnings report shared today. WBD was $40 billion in debt at the time of merger talks but said it was eyeing a profitable streaming business. WBD is still in debt currently but reported this month that its streaming business became profitable, making $103 million for the year. Max's most recent subscriber count is 97.7 million compared to 67.5 million for Paramount+."

He noted that the company aims to maximize profits from these assets by distributing them across various platforms, such as streaming, film, television, and licensing.\n\nIn the memo, Bakish expressed the company's commitment to advancing profitability in its streaming business. He emphasized a heightened focus on major markets such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, where the company maintains a robust presence and US studio content is particularly well-received.\n\nAuthored by Feba Bovas"

Paramount Global on Thursday (Mar 14) agreed to sell its 13 per cent stake in its Indian TV business to its partner, Ambani’s Reliance Industries, for US$517 million.\n\nDisney and Paramount’s transactions, including the discussions with the coffee-to-cars Tata conglomerate, show that global media giants are paring their exposure or exiting the Indian market as local players consolidate their holdings.

Pembunuhannya telak ditafsirkan sebagai deklarasi kemenangan di depan publik Israel, dan jalan untuk menegosiasikan jalan keluar dari Gaza.\n\nWarga Palestina memandang al-Arouri, yang diusir Israel dari Tepi Barat pada tahun 2010, sebagai seorang moderat di kelompok Hamas, dan orang yang membuka saluran bagi faksi-faksi Palestina lainnya.\n\nBaca Juga : Tolak Pemindahan Warga Palestina di Jalur Gaza, Raja Yordania Sentil Provokasi Ekstremis Israel\n\n“Arouri adalah seorang pemimpin yang berupaya membangun persatuan nasional di antara warga Palestina, dan pembunuhannya merupakan pukulan bagi seluruh rakyat Palestina,” kata seorang wanita Ramallah yang tidak disebutkan namanya.\n\n Warga Palestina di Tepi Barat menggelar domonstrasi dan aksi protes atas pembunuhan wakil pemimpin politik Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri di Beirut.

Banyak tempat usaha dan sekolah tutup, dan jalanan lebih sepi dari biasanya.\n\n\"Pastinya hati warga Yerusalem bersama Hamas dan perlawanan serta kerinduan atas apa yang terjadi pada warga sipil di Gaza. Kami hanya bisa melakukan perlawanan,\" ucap warga Yerusalem Timur, Azzam Abu Su, dikutip dari The New Arab, Kamis, 4 Januari 2024.\n\nHamas semakin populer di Tepi Barat sejak perang brutal Israel di Gaza dimulai pada 7 Oktober, dan pembunuhan al-Arouri semakin memperkuat popularitasnya.\n\n“Masyarakat Palestina sudah tidak sabar menunggu reaksi dari Hizbullah. Ini diharapkan menjadi reaksi bersama dari Hamas dan Hizbullah,” tambah Abu Su’oud.\n\n Pendiri Sayap Militer Hamas, Saleh Arouri. Photo : Mohammad Austaz/Hamas Media Office via AP.\n\nTransportasi antara kota-kota di Tepi Barat juga lumpuh karena aktivitas komersial dan kantor-kantor pemerintah mengindahkan seruan untuk hari berkabung.\n\nReaksi resmi pertama terhadap pembunuhan al-Arouri datang dari gerakan Fatah, yang mendominasi Otoritas Palestina dan pernah bentrok dengan Hamas di masa lalu. Anggota senior Fatah Jibril Rajoub mengatakan bahwa al-Arouri adalah model ketahanan di penjara-penjara pendudukan dan benih persatuan nasional.\n\nRajoub, yang pernah berbagi sel di penjara Israel dengan al-Arouri, kemudian bernegosiasi dengannya dalam dialog internal Palestina, yang bertujuan untuk mencapai persatuan setelah Hamas dan Fatah terlibat konflik di Gaza pada tahun 2007, dan berakhir dengan pengambilalihan wilayah Palestina oleh Hamas.\n\nRajoub menggambarkan kematian al-Arouri sebagai kerugian bagi Hamas.\n\nAl-Arouri adalah wakil kepala politbiro Hamas dan pemimpinnya di Tepi Barat. Dikatakan bahwa ia mendirikan cabang sayap bersenjata Hamas di Tepi Barat pada tahun 1991. Ia juga menjalani hukuman 15 tahun di penjara Israel. Setelah dibebaskan pada tahun 2010, Israel mengasingkan al-Arouri, dan memaksanya berangkat ke Suriah.\n\nKemudian, dia berpindah-pindah tempat tinggal antara Turki, Qatar, Malaysia, dan, terakhir, Lebanon, di mana serangan pesawat tak berawak membunuhnya.\n\nDi Jalur Gaza, sebagian orang melihat pembunuhan pemimpin Hamas sebagai upaya putus asa kepemimpinan Israel untuk memberikan kompensasi atas terhentinya kampanye militer, yang kini memasuki bulan ketiga.\n\nBashir Al-Rayes, dari Khan Younis, mengatakan bahwa pembunuhan al-Arouri mungkin menjadi awal dari berakhirnya perang di Gaza, setelah Israel gagal membunuh salah satu pemimpin utama Hamas di Gaza.\n\n“(Israel) telah kembali melakukan kebijakan pembunuhan terhadap para pemimpin Palestina, namun mereka lupa bahwa masalah Palestina tidak berakhir dengan pembunuhan para pemimpinnya, melainkan berakar dan tetap ada di benak seluruh warga Palestina,” tambahnya.\n\nMohammed Salha, berasal dari Kota Gaza, saat ini menjadi pengungsi dan tinggal di kota Rafah dekat perbatasan dengan Mesir.\n\n“Perlawanan Palestina akan tetap ada selama pendudukan masih ada di tanah Palestina, dan tidak ada pemimpin Israel yang mampu menghilangkan kehadiran dan entitas Palestina, tidak peduli berapa lama waktu yang dibutuhkan,” pungkasnya."

Hal itu secara luas dikaitkan dengan serangan pesawat tak berawak Israel penjajah, memicu kekhawatiran bahwa genosida di Gaza dapat melebar menjadi konflik regional.\n\n\"Kami telah menahan dua wanita di Tepi Barat yang diduduki, setelah mereka menghasut terorisme terhadap negara Israel,\" kata tentara Israel penjajah, Minggu 14 Januari 2024.\n\nAkan tetapi, mereka tidak menjelaskan lebih rinci mengenai sosok wanita yang diamankan tersebut. Saudara ipar Saleh al-Aruri, Awar al-Aruri mengatakan bahwa kedua wanita dan beberapa anggota keluarga lainnya telah dimasukkan ke dalam \"penahanan administratif\".\n\nSebuah kelompok kampanye, Klub Tahanan Palestina mengatakan bahwa Dalal al-Aruri (52) dan Fatima al-Aruri (47) ditangkap di lokasi terpisah dekat kota Ramallah. Keduanya ditangkap di rumah mereka di al-Bireh dan Aroura di Tepi Barat pada Minggu 14 Januari 2024 pagi.\n\nDituding Bantu Hamas Lancarkan Serangan 7 Oktober 2023\n\nTentara Israel penjajah menuduh saudara perempuan Saleh al-Aruri membantu merencanakan serangan 7 Oktober 2023 di Israel selatan oleh pejuang Hamas dari Gaza. Serangan itu mengakibatkan kematian 1.140 orang.\n\nGenosida yang dilakukan Israel penjajah di Gaza sejak itu menewaskan sedikitnya 23.843 orang, sebagian besar wanita dan anak-anak. Sementara itu, Klub Tahanan Palestina mengatakan bahwa 5.875 warga Palestina telah ditahan di Tepi Barat sejak pembantaian di Gaza dimulai.\n\nDikatakan bahwa, dari jumlah tersebut, 1.970 telah ditempatkan di bawah penahanan administratif, yang memungkinkan tersangka ditahan tanpa tuduhan atau pengadilan untuk periode yang dapat diperbarui hingga enam bulan.\n\nIsrael penjajah mengatakan, penahanan administratif dimaksudkan untuk memungkinkan pihak berwenang menahan tersangka sambil terus mengumpulkan bukti, dengan tujuan mencegah serangan atau pelanggaran keamanan lainnya sementara itu."

Administrația Biden a repus, miercuri, miliția houthi, aliniată Iranului, pe o listă a grupărilor teroriste, au declarat oficialii americani, aceasta fiind cea mai recentă încercare a Washingtonului de a opri atacurile luptătorilor houthi asupra transporturilor internaționale. Luptătorii houthi spun că atacurile asupra navelor sunt în semn de protest față de bombardarea Fâșiei Gaza de către Israel.\n\nUPDATE 17 ianuarie, ora 20.00 : Tensiunile se extind în Orientul Mijlociu: Măsurile luate de Pakistan după atacul cu rachete efectuat de Iran\n\nPakistanul a anunţat miercuri că îşi recheamă ambasadorul de la Teheran după ce Iranul i-a încălcat spaţiul aerian, a anunţat Ministerul de Externe pakistanez, citat de Reuters.\n\nDe asemenea, Pakistanul nu va permite emisarului Iranului la Islamabad, aflat în vizită în ţara sa natală, să se întoarcă, a declarat purtătoarea de cuvânt a ministerului, conform unui comunicat.\n\nDetalii aici\n\nUPDATE 17 ianuarie, ora 15.19 Davos - Iranul spune că i-a împărtășit Irakului informații despre Mossad\n\nMinistrul iranian de externe, Hossein Amirabdollahian, a declarat, miercuri, că Teheranul a împărtășit Irakului informații despre ceea ce a spus că sunt activități ale agenției de informații israeliene, Mossad, în regiunea semiautonomă kurdă din Irak, scrie Rador Radio România.\n\nIranul a declarat că Gărzile Revoluționare au atacat luni „cartierul general de spionaj” al Israelului din Irak, în orașul Erbil.\n\nIrakul a negat ulterior că ar exista un astfel de centru de spionaj în țară.\n\nUPDATE 17 ianuarie, ora 11.27 Administraţia Biden salută anunţul Qatarului privind livrarea de medicamente pentru ostaticii israelieni din Fâşia Gaza\n\nAdministraţia preşedintelui american Joe Biden a salutat anunţul din partea Qatarului cu privire la un acord pentru trimiterea de medicamente către ostaticii israelieni capturaţi de Hamas, precum şi suplimentarea ajutoarelor pentru palestinienii din Fâşia Gaza, scrie BBC.\n\nMinisterul de Externe din Qatar a anunţat că un transport cu ajutoare va pleca miercuri de la Doha către Egipt, de unde ajutoarele vor fi distribuite în Fâşia Gaza.\n\nUPDATE 17 ianuarie, ora 09.58 Rezumatul ultimelor 24 de ore din Orientul Mijlociu: tensiuni, acorduri și incidente militare\n\nEvenimentele cheie ale ultimei zile în Orientul Mijlociu includ un acord de livrare a medicamentelor în Gaza, atacuri aeriene iraniene în Pakistan și operațiuni militare ale SUA în Yemen.\n\nUn acord pentru a permite livrarea de medicamente ostaticilor din Gaza și de ajutoare în teritoriu a fost convenit după medierea Doha și Paris, au anunțat Qatar și Israel, relatează The Guardian.\n\nIranul a lansat atacuri aeriene pe teritoriul Pakistanului, care se pare că vizează un grup militant sunnit, în cel mai recent semn al unui val de violență care se răspândește în Orientul Mijlociu și nu numai.\n\nForțele americane au distrus patru rachete anti-navă în Yemen. SUA au declarat că rachetele amenințau navele civile și militare.\n\nLovitura a avut loc după cel mai recent atac asupra transportului maritim din Marea Roșie, în care Houthis au lovit cu o rachetă un cargobot deținut de greci în largul coastelor Yemenului, în timp ce se îndrepta spre canalul Suez. Nu au fost raportați răniți, iar nava a rămas funcțională.\n\nFranța afirmă că nu a luat parte la atacurile conduse de SUA împotriva Houthis în Yemen deoarece dorește să evite o escaladare regională.\n\nAdministrația Biden urmează să anunțe planurile de redenumire a rebelilor houthi din Yemen ca teroriști globali special desemnați, relatează Associated Press.\n\nCompania japoneză Nippon Yusen spune că se alătură altor mari companii de transport maritim și suspendă rutele prin Marea Roșie ca răspuns la atacurile Houthi asupra navelor din această cale navigabilă vitală.\n\nAgențiile umanitare au început să suspende operațiunile vitale din Yemen după recentele atacuri ale SUA și Marii Britanii asupra unor ținte Houthi, pe fondul avertismentelor că o nouă intervenție militară riscă să adâncească una dintre cele mai grave crize umanitare din lume.\n\nComandamentul Central al SUA a declarat marți că a confiscat la 11 ianuarie arme convenționale avansate iraniene destinate Houthis din Yemen. Aceasta a fost prima captură de \"arme convenționale avansate letale furnizate de Iran\" către Houthis de când au început atacurile Houthi împotriva navelor comerciale în noiembrie, a adăugat declarația.\n\nUS Navy Seals au abordat o navă care se îndrepta spre Yemen și au confiscat componente de rachete de fabricație iraniană și alte arme destinate forțelor Houthi, într-o operațiune în care doi comandouri Seal au dispărut, a declarat armata americană.\n\nIrakul a condamnat marți \"agresiunea\" Iranului asupra Erbilului, care a provocat victime civile în zone rezidențiale, potrivit unei declarații a Ministerului de Externe al țării, după ce Gardienii Revoluției iraniene au declarat că au atacat \"cartierul general de spionaj\" al Israelului în regiunea Kurdistan din Irak.\n\nUn purtător de cuvânt al Departamentului de Stat al SUA a declarat că un atac iranian în apropierea orașului Erbil, situat în nordul Irakului, a declarat luni că \"subminează stabilitatea Irakului\". \"Ne opunem atacurilor nesăbuite cu rachete ale Iranului\", a declarat Matthew Miller, adăugând că SUA sprijină \"eforturile guvernului irakian și ale guvernului regional din Kurdistan de a răspunde aspirațiilor poporului irakian\".\n\nGărzile Revoluționare ale Iranului au revendicat, de asemenea, un atac în Siria. Gruparea a declarat că a tras o serie de rachete balistice asupra unor \"operațiuni teroriste\" din țară - inclusiv asupra unor ținte ale Statului Islamic - și le-a distrus. Un oficial american din domeniul apărării, care a vorbit sub protecția anonimatului, a declarat că SUA au urmărit rachetele, care au lovit în nordul Irakului și în nordul Siriei, iar primele indicații au fost că loviturile au fost \"nesăbuite și imprecise\".\n\nArmata israeliană a declarat miercuri că forțele sale au 'eliminat' o 'celulă teroristă' în timpul unui raid aerian în tabăra Balata din orașul Nablus, ocupat de Israel, transmite Reuters.\n\nSecretarul de stat al ONU, António Guterres, a postat pe X în urmă cu câteva ore despre preocupările sale cu privire la războiul din Gaza și la extinderea conflictului. El spune: \"Cu cât conflictul din Gaza continuă mai mult timp, cu atât mai mare este riscul de escaladare și de calcul greșit\". Ambasadorul Israelului la Națiunile Unite, Gilad Erdan, a postat un răspuns în care dă vina pe Iran pentru instabilitatea regională.\n\nBiroul Națiunilor Unite pentru coordonarea afacerilor umanitare (Ocha) a publicat cea mai recentă actualizare a situației din Gaza: \"Începând cu data de 15 ianuarie, doar una dintre cele trei conducte de apă din Israel în Gaza funcționează. Conducta de apă din Deir al-Balah, cu o capacitate de aproape 17.000 de metri cubi de apă pe zi, are nevoie urgentă de reparații.\"\n\nSenatorii americani au respins o măsură, introdusă de Bernie Sanders, care ar fi condiționat ajutorul militar acordat Israelului de faptul că guvernul israelian încalcă drepturile omului și acordurile internaționale în războiul devastator din Gaza.\n\nMinistrul australian al afacerilor externe, Penny Wong, s-a întâlnit cu rudele israeliene ale ostaticilor deținuți de Hamas și le-a asigurat că va continua să folosească vocea Australiei pentru a cere întoarcerea imediată, necondiționată și în siguranță a tuturor ostaticilor.\n\nUPDATE 17 ianuarie, ora 09.05 Raiduri aeriene intense ale Israelului în oraşul Khan Yunis din Fâşia Gaza\n\nPalestinieni din sudul Fâşiei Gaza afirmă că au avut loc raiduri aeriene intense ale Israelului în oraşul Khan Yunis pe timpul nopţii. De asemenea, tancuri israeliene au revenit în zone din nordul Fâşiei Gaza de unde s-au retras recent, scrie Rador Radio România.\n\nAnterior, Israelul a anunţat că etapa intensă a operaţiunii sale militare în zonă s-a încheiat şi că în curând se va încheia şi în partea de sud a Fâşiei Gaza.\n\nUPDATE 17 ianuarie, ora 08.34 Armata israeliană anunţă că a eliminat o \"celulă teroristă\", în tabăra Balata din Cisiordania\n\nArmata israeliană a anunţat miercuri că forţele israeliene au eliminat o \"celulă teroristă\" în timpul unui raid aerian de precizie în tabăra Balata, din oraşul palestinian Nablus, ocupat de Israel, din Cisiordania, scrie Rador Radio România.\n\nÎntr-un comunicat, armata anunţă că l-a eliminat pe Abdullah Abu-Shalal, \"liderul infrastructurii teroriste\" a taberei, care plănuia să comită un atac terorist iminent, la scară largă, alături de membri ai celulei sale.\n\nUPDATE 17 ianuarie, ora 03.20: Acord între Israel şi Hamas: ostaticii din Gaza vor primi medicamente şi ajutoare\n\nS-a ajuns la un acord pentru a permite livrarea de medicamente ostaticilor din Gaza şi acordarea de ajutoare în teritoriu, au anunţat, marţi, Qatar şi Israel, transmite AFP, citat de news.ro.\n\nÎntr-o declaraţie pentru agenţia oficială de ştiri din Qatar (QNA), Doha a anunţat acordul \"între Israel şi (Hamas), prin care medicamentele, împreună cu alte ajutoare umanitare, vor fi livrate civililor din Gaza... în schimbul livrării medicamentelor necesare pentru prizonierii israelieni din Gaza\".\n\nContinuarea aici\n\nUPDATE 17 ianuarie, ora 03.20: UE dă o lovitură puternică Hamas - Unul dintre cei mai importanți lideri Hamas a fost pus pe lista teroriștilor iar bunurile au fost înghețate\n\nUniunea Europeană îl adaugă oficial pe liderul Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, pe lista teroristă. Activele lui Sinwar în statele membre UE vor fi înghețate și nu i se vor putea pune la dispoziție resurse economice din statele UE.\n\n„Decizia vine ca parte a răspunsului Uniunii Europene la amenințarea reprezentată de Hamas și atacurile sale teroriste brutale și nediscriminatorii din Israel din 7 octombrie 2023”, se arată într-o declarație oficială a Consiliului Uniunii Europene.\n\nContinuarea aici"

Mahkamah Agung Israel kemudian memvonis dia bebas tapi diasingkan dari Palestina.\n\nDia kemudian dideportasi ke Suriah dan tinggal di sana selama tiga tahun sebelum berkelana ke sejumlah negara sampai terakhir di Lebanon hingga dibunuh Israel pada 2 Januari 2024.\n\nArouri adalah salah seorang juru runding Hamas saat pertukaran tawanan Palestina-Israel pada 2011 ketika serdadu Israel bernama Gilad Shalit dibebaskan yang dipertukarkan dengan 1.027 warga Palestina yang dipenjarakan Israel.\n\nPada 31 Juli 2021, Arouri terpilih kembali sebagai wakil ketua biro politik Hamas untuk kedua kalinya.

Televíziójuk, az al-Aksza TV Telegram-csatornáján azt jelentette, hogy a Bejrút Dahíhe nevű elővárosában végrehajtott támadásban meghalt a Hamász katonai szárnyának, az al-Kasszám Brigádoknak két vezetője is: Szamír Abu Amer és Azzám al-Akraa Abu Ammar.\n\nSzáleh Arúri, a Hamász katonai szárnyának egyik alapítója, a Hamász politikai bizottságának alelnöke és a szervezet ciszjordániai vezetője volt. Évek óta élt száműzetésben Libanonban. Arúri a testőreivel együtt halt meg az izraeli légitámadásban, amelynek célpontja a síita Hezbollah erősségének számító városnegyedben lévő Hamász-iroda volt.\n\nArúri közel húsz évet töltött izraeli börtönökben, 2010-ben szabadlábra helyezték azzal a feltétellel, hogy emigrációba vonul. Szemtanúk szerint üres ciszjordániai házát október végén az izraeli hadsereg felrobbantotta.\n\nEgy libanoni biztonsági vezető közölte: Szamír Fandi, egy másik Hamász-vezető is meghalt a csapásban.\n\nArúri halálát a térség több vezetője elítélte. Nadzsib Mikáti libanoni miniszterelnök bírálta \"az újabb izraeli bűntettet, amelynek célja Libanon bevonása a konfrontáció újabb szakaszába\".\n\nMohamed Stajje, a Palesztin Hatóság miniszterelnöke elítélte a támadást, és figyelmeztetett az abból eredő esetleges kockázatokra és következményekre.\n\n\"Egy mozgalmat, amelynek a vezetői és alapítói mártírhalált halnak népünk és nemzetünk méltóságáért, sohasem fognak legyőzni\" - hangoztatta Iszmail Haníje, a Hamász vezetője, aki televíziós beszédében terrorcselekménynek nevezte Arúri meggyilkolását. Hozzátette, hogy a mozgalom vezetőinek meggyilkolása után \"még erősebb és elszántabb lesz\".\n\nAz Iszlám Dzsihád fegyveres gázai szervezet bírálta a cionista ellenség kísérletét (...) hogy bevonják az egész térséget a háborúba.\n\nDaniel Hagari, az izraeli hadsereg szóvivője röviddel Arúri megölése után tartott napi sajtótájékoztatóján - a bejrúti támadást közvetlenül nem említve - kijelentette, hogy a hadsereg fokozott készültségben van, és kész bármilyen forgatókönyvre.\n\nA Hezbollah a Telegram üzenetküldő alkalmazásban közleményében hangsúlyozta: a magas rangú Hamász-vezető bejrúti megölése súlyos támadás Libanon ellen, és veszélyes fejlemény az ellenség és az ellenállás tengelye közötti háborúban. Hozzátette: Száleh Arúri meggyilkolása \"nem marad válasz, illetve büntetés nélkül\", és a mozgalom \"a ravaszon tartja az ujját\".\n\nIrán szerint Iszmail Haníje Hamász-vezető helyettesének meggyilkolása csak tovább fogja szítani az ellenállást.\n\n\"A mártír vére kétségkívül tovább szítja az ellenállást és a harckészséget a cionista megszállók ellen, nemcsak Palesztinában, hanem a térségben és világszerte azok között, akik a szabadságot keresik\" - jelentette ki Nasszer Kanaáni, az iráni külügyminisztérium szóvivője.

Comentariile miniștrilor israelieni au părut să sublinieze temerile unei mari părți a lumii arabe că Israelul dorește să îi alunge pe palestinieni de pe teritoriile pe care doresc să construiască un viitor stat, ceea ce va repeta deposedarea în masă a palestinienilor de pământurile lor – episod petrecut atunci când Israelul a fost creat, în anul 1948. Mai multe detalii: „Retorică inflamatorie și iresponsabilă”.

Ana Blandiana, revoltată: „Încă o pată pe obrazul Academiei” Purtătorul de cuvânt al Consiliului Național de Securitate al Casei Albe, John Kirby, a declarat miercuri că Hamas „are încă o poziție de forță semnificativă în interiorul Gaza, dar obiectivul Israelului de a învinge gruparea teroristă rămâne realizabil”, scrie The Times of Israel. Kirby admite, totuși, că, deși este posibil ca Israelul să diminueze semnificativ capacitățile Hamas prin eliminarea conducerii grupării islamiste, armata islamistă (IDF) nu va putea probabil să „șteargă existența mișcării”. „Probabil că nu veți elimina ideologia”, a spus Kirby, reiterând convingerea SUA că doar prin prezentarea unei căi viabile spre pace poate fi combătută cu succes viziunea Hamas. Potrivit lui Kirby, consilierul american pentru securitate națională, Jake Sullivan, a avut marți o convorbire telefonică cu ministrul israelian al afacerilor strategice, Ron Dermer, un apropiat de rang înalt al premierului Benjamin Netanyahu, pentru a discuta despre războiul din Gaza și despre eforturile de a asigura eliberarea ostaticilor rămași în enclavă în mâinile Hamas. Kirby a insistat asupra faptului că negocierile privind eliberarea ostaticilor sunt în derulare și sunt serioase, în ciuda faptului că în spațiul public au apărut tot mai multe informații potrivit cărora Israelul și Hamas au poziții aproape ireconciliabile în această chestiune.

(Fluxul) este prea inconsecvent, iar numărul camioanelor care intră în fiecare zi trebuie să crească dramatic și trebuie să rămână ridicat”, a afirmat Miller. „Acesta continuă să fie punctul central al angajamentului nostru și al unor conversații foarte directe și sincere cu guvernul Israelului, precum și cu alte țări din regiune care pot juca un rol important”, a precizat purtătorul de cuvânt al Departamentului de Stat. Separat, Miller a respins acuzația de genocid adusă Israelului de Africa de Sud la Curtea Internațională de Justiție, afirmând că SUA „nu văd niciun act care să constituie genocid” din partea Israelului în războiul împotriva Hamas.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an SUA nu au „niciun indiciu” că Israelul s-a aflat în spatele exploziilor care au zguduit Iranul Statele Unite nu au văzut până acum niciun indiciu că Israelul s-a aflat în spatele celor două explozii de miercuri din Iran, de la ceremonia de comemorare a comandantului Qasssem Soleimani, a anunțat Casa Albă, potrivit Sky News. Presa de stat iraniană a anunțat că cel puțin 103 persoane au fost ucise în exploziile din orașul Kerman. Exploziile au avut loc în timp ce sute de persoane participau la un eveniment în memoria lui Soleimani, care a fost ucis într-un atac cu dronă al SUA în 2020. Imaginile sugerează că exploziile au avut loc la aproximativ 15 minute distanță. Președintele iranian Ebrahim Raisi a condamnat „crima odioasă și inumană”, iar liderul suprem al Iranului, Ayatollahul Khamenei, autoritatea supremă a țării, a promis răzbunare pentru acest „atentat”. Incidentul nu a fost până acum revendicat de nicio grupare sau țară.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Mai mulți oameni au fost uciși în urma unor bombardamente intense de artilerie în apropierea unui spital din orașul Khan Younis Mai multe persoane au murit în urma unor bombardamente de artilerie în apropierea unui spital din sudul Fâșiei Gaza, potrivit Societății Semilunii Roșii Palestiniene (PRCS), care administrează unitatea medicală. Organizația nu a furnizat numărul specific de persoane ucise, scrie CNN. „Tirul intens al artileriei se intensifică în apropierea spitalului Al-Amal din Khan Younis, la mai puțin de 100 de metri de clădirea spitalului, ceea ce a dus la un număr de martiri și răniți”, a transmis PRCS, într-o postare pe rețelele de socializare. Marți, PRCS anunțase că cinci persoane au fost ucise și alte trei au fost rănite în bombardamente efectuate în apropierea aceluiași spital din Khan Younis. Armata israeliană a anunțat miercuri că a deschis o anchetă în urma acelui incident. În timp ce unele părți din Gaza au fost mai liniștite după retragerea unor unități israeliene, luptele intense continuă în zona Khan Younis, potrivit atât armatei israeliene, cât și aripii militare a Hamas. „Trupele, inclusiv corpurile blindate și forțele de geniu, au efectuat raiduri țintite asupra unor locații centrale din zonă”, a anunțat miercuri IDF, evocând „lupte intense” într-un cartier din acest oraș sudic al Fâșiei Gaza.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Armata este pregătită de luptă în nordul țării, afirmă șeful IDF, care promite să întărească apărarea la granițe În timpul unei vizite la granița de nord a Israelului, șeful Statului Major al IDF, generalul-locotenent Herzi Halevi, a declarat miercuri că armata israeliană se află într-o „stare de pregătire foarte puternică în nord”, dar rămâne concentrată pe lupta împotriva Hamas, scrie The Times of Israel. Afirmațiile acestuia vin la o zi după ce Israelul l-ar fi asasinat pe numărul 2 al Hamas, Saleh Al-Arouri, în Liban. Gruparea șiită libaneză Hezbollah, care a efectuat atacuri zilnice asupra nordului Israelului începând din 8 octombrie, a promis că va răspunde. „Ne aflăm într-o stare de pregătire foarte puternică în nord, cred eu. Efectuez des vizite aici, cred că starea de pregătire este în punctul maxim”, a declarat Halevi, în timpul unei evaluări la acre au participat șeful Comandamentului de Nord, generalul-maior Ori Gordin, comandantul Diviziei Regionale 210, generalul de brigadă Zion Ratzon, și comandanții unităților de rezerviști de la graniță. „Suntem foarte bine pregătiți în toate domeniile, iar în prezent ne concentrăm pe lupta împotriva Hamas”, a spus Halevi. El a adăugat că războiul, în ciuda circumstanțelor dificile care au dus la el, oferă „un fel de oportunitate de a schimba situația într-un mod foarte semnificativ”, atât în sud, cât și în nord. „Privim înainte, vom schimba rutina de apărare, vom avea cel puțin în următorul an mult mai multe forțe la granițe și vom ajunge la ceva mult mai puternic. Pentru că acest incident, oricât de dificil ar fi (asaltul Hamas, n.r.), nu se poate repeta, asta este sigur”, adaugă Halevi, referindu-se la masacrele din 7 octombrie din sudul Israelului.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an O aeronavă din Qatar cu 37 de tone de ajutoare umanitare pentru palestinienii din Gaza a aterizat în Egipt O aeronavă qatareză care transporta 37 de tone de ajutoare pentru palestinienii din Fâșia Gaza a aterizat miercuri la El Arish, în Egipt, scrie The Guardian. Ajutorul include kituri de adăposturi și produse alimentare care urmează să fie transferate în continuare în Gaza, a anunțat Ministerul de Externe din Qatar, într-un comunicat.

Israelul a fost învinuit pentru explozia din Liban, dar nu a comentat încă cine a fost în spatele atacului. Purtătorul de cuvânt al Departamentului de Stat al SUA, Matthew Miller, a declarat că Washingtonul nu a fost anunțat în avans despre atac și nu poate face o evaluare în privința autorului acestuia. Referindu-se la Saleh al-Arouri, numărul 2 din Hamas, Miller l-a descris pe acesta ca fiind „un terorist brutal cu sânge de civili pe mâini”.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Amenințând Israelul, Nasrallah spune că Hezbollah nu se teme de război, că va lupta „fără reguli” și că răspunsul său va fi „fără limite” În discursul de miercuri, Hassan Nasrallah a amenințat Israelul, afirmând că gruparea șiită libaneză nu se teme de luptă și spunând că nu va da înapoi dacă va izbucni un război, scriu The Times of Israel și CNN. El a adăugat că bombardamentele transfrontaliere ale Hezbollah asupra Israelului, începând din 8 octombrie, au împiedicat derularea unei campanii și mai ample de bombardamente a Israelului asupra Fâșiei Gaza, avertizând că nu va exista „nicio cedare” și „nicio regulă” din partea grupării sale dacă Israelul va lansa un război în Liban. „Luptăm într-o (zonă de) graniță și cunoaștem calculele… dar dacă inamicul s-a gândit să lanseze un război în Liban, va lupta la o graniță unde nu vor exista reguli sau linii directoare”, a adăugat liderul Hezbollah, potrivit Sky News. Hassan Nasrallah a spus că, dacă Israelul va porni un război cu Libanul, răspunsul Hezbollah va fi „fără limite”, adăugând că uciderea marți la Beirut a numărului 2 din Hamas „nu va rămâne nepedepsită”.

Hezbollah și Hamas au acuzat și anterior Israelul pentru uciderea lui Saleh al-Arouri, numărului 2 din gruparea islamistă palestiniană, deși guvernul lui Benjamin Netanyahu nu a recunoscut oficial implicarea în atacul din Beirut asupra lui Arouri sau în exploziile care au zguduit miercuri Iranul. El a calificat uciderea lui Arouri drept „o agresiune israeliană flagrantă”, care a vizat suburbia Dahiyeh. Dahiyeh este o suburbie predominant musulmană șiită situată la sud de centrul Beirutului, unde Hamas avea un birou. Hezbollah sprijină Hamas și este susținută de Iran în opoziția sa existențială agresivă față de Israel.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Luptele au făcut ravagii în Fâșia Gaza în ultimele 24 de ore, iar bilanțul oamenilor uciși în enclava palestiniană a trecut de 22.300 În ultimele 24 de ore au avut loc lupte și atacuri israeliene în mai multe zone din Fâșia Gaza, potrivit Forțelor de Apărare Israeliene (IDF) și surselor din enclava palestiniană, relatează CNN. O înregistrare video din tabăra de refugiați din Jabalia arată urmările unei importante explozii care s-a soldat cu mai multe victime civile. Ministerul Sănătății din Gaza, controlat de Hamas, a declarat că „zeci” de persoane au fost „ucise sau rănite” după ce casa unei familii din Jabalia a fost vizată. CNN menționează că a contactat IDF pentru a comenta operațiunile sale din zonă. Înainte de explozia din Jabalia, Ministerul Sănătății din Gaza anunțase că, în ultimele 24 de ore, 128 de persoane au fost ucise în Gaza și alte 261 au fost rănite. Potrivit ministerului, numărul total al persoanelor ucise în Gaza începând din 7 octombrie a crescut la 22.313, iar peste 57.000 de persoane au fost rănite. Ministerul din Gaza, ca și Ministerul Sănătății din Cisiordania ocupată, estimează că aproximativ 70% dintre victime sunt femei și copii. CNN precizează că nu poate confirma în mod independent bilanțul furnizat de ministerul din Gaza, din cauza accesului restricționat în regiune și a dificultății de a verifica cifrele exacte pe fondul conflictului în derulare. În timp ce unele părți din Gaza au fost mai liniștite după retragerea unor unități israeliene, luptele intense continuă în zona orașului Khan Younis, din sudul enclavei, potrivit atât IDF, cât și aripii militare a Hamas. Armata israelianp a precizat că trupele sale au localizat un puț de tunel în interiorul unei școli din cartierul Khirbet Khuza’a din Khan Younis „și i-au ucis pe teroriștii care încercau să planteze un dispozitiv exploziv pe un tanc”. Trupele israeliene, „inclusiv corpuri blindate și forțele de geniu, au efectuat raiduri țintite asupra unor locații centrale din zonă”, a precizat IDF, care a menționat derularea unor lupte intense în Khan Younis.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Ostaticul Sahar Baruch a fost ucis în urmă cu o lună, în timpul unei tentative de salvare, anunță armata israeliană Armata israeliană (IDF) a înștiințat familia ostaticului Sahar Baruch că acesta a fost ucis pe 8 decembrie, în timpul unei încercări eșuate de a-l salva din Fâșia Gaza, din captivitatea Hamas, scrie miercuri The Times of Israel. Armata a precizat că nu poate determina în acest stadiu cauza morții lui Baruch și că nu se știe dacă el a fost ucis de Hamas sau de focurile soldaților israelieni. La momentul respectiv, Hamas a susținut că Baruch a fost ucis de către IDF, publicând imagini cu cadavrul său. Doi soldați ai IDF au fost grav răniți în tentativa eșuată de salvare a unor ostatici, a anunțat armata israeliană după incident.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Ce efect va avea asupra războiului din Fâșia Gaza asasinarea numărului 2 din Hamas Uciderea în Liban a lui Saleh al-Arouri, un înalt lider Hamas care a avut un rol major în interiorul organizației, ar putea complica și mai mult războiul din Orientul Mijlociu, escaladând mizele și amploarea conflictului, spun analiștii citați de BBC și New York Times. Saleh al-Arouri, un lider politic adjunct al organizației teroriste aflate la conducerea Fâșiei Gaza, a fost ucis marți într-un atac cu dronă în sudul Beirutului. El era o figură-cheie în Brigăzile Izzedine al-Qassam, aripa armată a Hamas, și un aliat apropiat al lui Ismail Haniyeh, liderul suprem al organizației. Mai multe detalii: „Hamas va suferi, dar nu va paraliza”. Ce efect va avea asasinarea șefului adjunct al organizației palestiniene asupra războiului din Gaza\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Mossad promite să se răzbune împotriva Hamas pentru asaltul din 7 octombrie David Barnea, şeful Mossad – serviciul de informaţii externe al Israelului – a declarat miercuri că agenţia sa „îşi va regla conturile” cu orice persoană implicată în sângerosul atac comis de gruparea islamistă palestiniană Hamas pe 7 octombrie în comunităţile din sudul Israelului, informează AFP. „Astăzi suntem în plin război. Şi Mossadul astăzi, la fel ca acum 50 de ani, se angajează să-şi regleze conturile cu ucigaşii care au trecut de marginea Fâşiei Gaza la 7 octombrie, cu planificatorii şi cu sponsorii lor”, a declarat David Barnea, în timpul funeraliilor fostului şef al Mossad, Zvi Zamir, decedat marţi. Mai multe detalii: Șeful Mossad promite răzbunare împotriva Hamas pentru asaltul din 7 octombrie, citând versete biblice: „Fiecare mamă arabă trebuie să știe”\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Șeful diplomației europene: Soluţia la conflictul israeliano-palestinian trebuie „impusă din exterior” O posibilă rezolvare a conflictului dintre Israel şi palestinieni va trebui să fie „impusă din exterior” de către comunitatea internaţională pentru că „cele două părţi nu vor putea niciodată să ajungă la un acord”, a declarat miercuri şeful diplomaţiei europene, Josep Borrell, într-un discurs rostit la o conferinţă diplomatică la Lisabona, potrivit AFP. „Ceea ce am învăţat în ultimii 30 de ani şi ceea ce învăţăm acum cu tragedia din Gaza este că soluţia trebuie impusă din exterior”, a afirmat Borrell, la Seminarul Diplomatic 2024 din capitala Portugaliei. „Pacea va fi obţinută în mod durabil doar dacă comunitatea internaţională se implică intens pentru a o realiza şi va impune o soluţie”, a subliniat el, referindu-se la un efort la care trebuie să participe „Statele Unite, europenii şi arabii”. A doua zi după ce un atac aerian în apropiere de Beirut a ucis un lider de rang înalt al mişcării islamiste palestiniene Hamas, ceea ce a realimentat temerile privind o extindere a conflictului, Borrell, care intenţiona să meargă joi în Liban, a afirmat, de asemenea, că această călătorie ar putea fi anulată. „Ceea ce s-a întâmplat ieri cu moartea liderilor Hamas este un factor suplimentar care poate provoca o escaladare a conflictului”, a declarat Înaltul reprezentant al UE pentru afaceri externe, în cadrul unei conferinţe de presă după discursul său de la seminarul diplomatic portughez, potrivit Agerpres. Deşi nu a revendicat responsabilitatea pentru eliminarea marţi seara la Beirut a numărului doi al grupării islamiste palestiniene Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri, Israelul este considerat responsabil pentru lovitura fatală asupra fondatorului aripii militare a mişcării.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Rebelii houthi au efectuat un nou atac asupra unei nave comerciale în Marea Roşie Rebelii houthi din Yemen au revendicat miercuri un nou atac asupra unei nave port-container a companiei franceze de transport maritim CMA CGM în zona strâmtorii Bab al-Mandeb din Marea Roşie, informează EFE și Reuters. Un purtător de cuvânt al rebelilor, care a făcut acest anunţ, a susţinut că respectiva navă se îndrepta către Israel şi că echipajul a ignorat avertismentele de a se opri. Operatorul francez al navei a precizat că aceasta şi echipajul său sunt în siguranţă după atac şi că destinaţia era un port egiptean. Rebelii houthi, apropiaţi de Iran şi care controlează coasta vestică a Yemenului, au ameninţat că orice navă aflată în zonă şi a cărei destinaţie este Israelul poate fi o ţintă a lor, ca ripostă faţă de ofensiva armatei israeliene împotriva grupării Hamas în Fâşia Gaza. Purtătorul lor de cuvânt menţionat mai sus a spus miercuri că rebelii vor continua să atace „navele israeliene sau cele care se îndreaptă către porturile Palestinei ocupate (…) până când li se vor oferi proviziile necesare de alimente şi medicamente fraţilor noştri din Fâşia Gaza”. Acesta a avertizat şi „inamicul american sau orice altă parte că orice agresiune americană nu va rămâne fără răspuns”, potrivit Agerpres. Comandamentul american pentru Orientul Mijlociu (CENTCOM) a precizat miercuri că, în cursul nopţii, rebelii houthi au lansat două rachete balistice care au explodat în apropierea a două nave comerciale în partea de sud a Mării Roşii, fără a provoca pagube.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Iranul avertizează că tensiunile vor creşte, în urma asasinării în Liban a numărului 2 al Hamas Uciderea unui important lider al mişcării islamiste palestiniene Hamas va avea cu siguranţă consecinţe, a afirmat miercuri ministrul iranian al apărării, care a învinuit totodată SUA pentru creşterea tensiunilor, scrie Agerpres preluând agenția DPA. Principala responsabilitate o poartă politica Statelor Unite, a declarat Mohammad-Reza Gharaei Ashtiani înainte de o reuniune a cabinetului la Teheran. „Le ajunge fumul în propriii ochi”, a spus acesta, referindu-se la americani. Numărul doi al grupării islamiste palestiniene Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri, a fost ucis marţi seară într-un atac aerian în suburbiile capitalei libaneze Beirut, au anunţat gruparea palestiniană şi responsabili libanezi. Hamas a învinuit imediat Israelul pentru acest atac, iar Israelul nu comentează în legătură cu presupuse atacuri sau asasinate „ţintite” în străinătate. Teheranul, la rândul său, a atribuit Israelului vina pentru asasinat. „Activităţile rău intenţionate ale maşinăriei teroriste a acestui regim israelian în alte ţări sunt o ameninţare reală la adresa păcii şi securităţii”, a transmis, pe reţeaua X, ministrul de externe iranian, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Israelul negociază în secret cu Congo să-i mute acolo pe palestinienii din Fâşia Gaza Oficiali israelieni anunţă că poartă negocieri secrete cu Congo şi mai multe alte ţări care să-i găzduiască pe palestinienii din Fâşia Gaza, scrie publicaţia de limbă ebraică Zman Yisrael, potrivit Le Figaro. „Congo ar fi dispusă să primească migranţi, iar noi suntem în negocieri şi cu alţii”, declara marţi o sursă „bine informată” din cadrul Cabinetului israelian de Securitate, potrivit acestei publicaţii, partenera comercială a cotidianului online Times of Israel. Problema viitorului populaţiei palestiniene după Războiul din Fâşia Gaza este un subiect fierbinte între Israel şi aliaţii săi. Marţi, Statele Unite au condamnat declaraţiile a doi miniştri de extremă dreapta – Bezalel Smotrich şi Itamar Ben Gvir – care promovează ideea unei mutări a palestinienilor în afara Fâşiei Gaza. La sfârşitul lui noiembrie, ministrul israelian al Informaţiilor, Gila Gamliel, declara că educaţia în favoarea urii va rămâne prezentă în Fâşia Gaza, la fel ca ameninţarea unor noi atacuri împotriva Israelului. Ea afirma tot atunci că ideea unei „emigrări umanitare” a populaţiei Fâşiei Gaza este o „opţiune”. ”În loc să se aloce bani în vederea unei reconstrucţii a Fâşiei Gaza sau unei UNRWA (agenția ONU pentru refugiații palestinieni, n.r.) în faliment, comunitatea internaţională poate contribui la costurile mutării, ajutând astfel populaţia din (Fâşia) Gaza să-şi construiască o nouă viaţă în noua sa ţară gazdă”, declara Gila Gamliel, care face din Partidul Likud al lui Benjamin Netanyahu, pentru The Jerusalem Post, potrivit news.ro. Mai multe detalii: Israelul negociază cu Congo și alte țări un „plan de migrație voluntară”, prin care palestinienii din Fâșia Gaza să fie relocați după război\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Un alt ministru israelian propune plecarea în masă palestinienilor din Fâşia Gaza Ministrul israelian al securităţii naţionale, Itamar Ben Gvir, a recomandat din nou miercuri plecarea în masă a palestinienilor din Fâşia Gaza, informează AFP. El a respins ca „iresponsabile” criticile americane privind declaraţiile sale anterioare în acelaşi sens. „Statele Unite sunt prietenii noştri buni, dar înainte de toate vom face ceea ce este bine pentru statul Israel: încurajarea emigraţiei a sute de mii de oameni din Gaza le va permite rezidenţilor (israelieni) să revină la casele lor (la frontiera cu Gaza, n.r.) şi să trăiască în siguranţă, protejându-ne în acelaşi timp soldaţii”, a scris oficialul în reţeaua X, ca reacţie la criticile de la Washington. Ben Gvir, lider al partidului de extremă dreaptă Forţa Evreiască, susţinător al colonizării, a cerut luni revenirea coloniştilor evrei în Gaza, după încheierea războiului împotriva Hamas, şi încurajarea palestinienilor să emigreze. Cu o zi înainte, un alt ministru din aceeaşi extremă a spectrului politic, Bezalel Smotrich, titularul Finanţelor, făcuse declaraţii similare. Convenţiile de la Geneva interzic expulzarea populaţiilor de pe teritoriile unde trăiesc; acordurile respective reprezintă nucleul legislaţiei umanitare internaţionale. Totodată, statutele Curţii Penale Internaţionale consideră „deportarea sau transferul forţat al populaţiilor” o crimă împotriva umanităţii, notează AFP. Reacția SUA: Astfel de propuneri sunt iresponsabile Matthew Miller, purtător de cuvânt al Departamentului de Stat american, a declarat marţi într-un comunicat că „Statele Unite resping declaraţiile recente ale miniştrilor israelieni Bezalel Smotrich şi Itamar Ben Gvir, care propovăduiesc strămutarea palestinienilor în afara Fâşiei Gaza”. El a apreciat că poziţiile celor doi miniştri sunt „iresponsabile”. Smotrich, şeful partidului Sionismul Religios, şi-a reluat ideea și miercuri, susţinând – potrivit presei – că „70% din opinia publică israeliană ar susţine emigrarea voluntară a arabilor din Gaza şi absorbţia lor în alte ţări”. El a afirmat că „susţinătorii unei astfel de soluţii umanitare înţeleg că o ţară mică, cum este a noastră, nu îşi poate permite o realitate în care la doar patru minute de localităţile noastre există un focar de ură şi teroare, unde două milioane de oameni se trezesc în fiecare dimineaţă cu dorinţa de a distruge statul Israel”.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Egiptul îşi îngheaţă rolul de mediator între Israel şi palestinieni după asasinarea numărului 2 al Hamas Egiptul şi-a îngheţat rolul de mediator între Israel şi facţiunile palestiniene pentru a căuta o soluţie la războiul din Fâşia Gaza, după asasinarea numărului doi al biroului politic al Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri, la periferia Beirutului, au declarat miercuri pentru agenția de presă EFE surse palestiniene şi egiptene, potrivit Agerpres. „Egiptul a informat oficial Israelul că şi-a îngheţat rolul de mediator între Israel şi facţiunile palestiniene pentru a încheia un acord care să conducă la încheierea războiului” în urma asasinarii lui Saleh al-Arouri, marţi, atribuită Israelului, au declarat sursele, care au cerut anonimatul ca urmare a caracterului sensibil al acestui subiect. Conform aceloraşi surse, mişcările Hamas şi Jihad Islamic au informat la rândul lor Cairo despre suspendarea negocierilor cu Israelul în vederea unei încetări a focului. Până acum, Egiptul nu a comunicat oficial acest pas. Autorităţile egiptene au confirmat săptămâna trecută că, în calitatea lor de mediator, au prezentat un plan în trei faze, pe care nu l-au explicat pe larg, pentru a ajunge la un acord prin care să se pună capăt războiului din Gaza după ce mai multe delegaţii palestiniene au vizitat Cairo. Surse palestiniene şi egiptene familiarizate cu conversaţiile au precizat pentru agenția spaniolă EFE, sub condiţia anonimatului, că Egiptul a propus Hamas şi Jihadul Islamic un „dialog naţional palestinian” pentru a pune capăt diviziunii dintre facţiuni şi a forma un „guvern tehnocrat” în Cisiordania şi Gaza. Acest guvern ar urma să supravegheze reconstrucţia Fâşiei Gaza şi ar pregăti terenul pentru alegerile parlamentare şi prezidenţiale palestiniene, au adăugat sursele citate. Această propunere reprezintă al doilea punct al planului pe trei axe şi al cărui obiectiv final este realizarea încetării definitive a atacurilor asupra Fâşiei Gaza şi retragerea armatei israeliene din enclava palestiniană. Prima axă a planului ar fi un armistiţiu de două săptămâni în schimbul eliberării a 40 de ostatici israelieni şi 120 de palestinieni, potrivit surselor menţionate.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Israelul a efectuat un atac cu dronă în Cisiordania Armata israeliană a anunțat că a efectuat un atac cu dronă împotriva unui grup de palestinieni înarmați în timpul unui raid în tabăra de refugiați Nur Shams din Cisiordania. Raidul de combatere a terorismului la scară largă în apropiere de Tulkarem a fost lansat în cursul nopții, iar până acum trupele au audiat zeci de suspecți și au reținut șase palestinieni. De asemenea, au fost confiscate mai multe echipamente militare. Atacul cu dronă a fost efectuat împotriva unui grup de palestinieni care aruncau dispozitive explozive asupra trupelor israeliene, spune armata. Nu este cunoscut dacă aceștia au fost uciși sau răniți în urma atacului, iar armata spune că operațiunea continuă la această oră. În Qalqilya, armata susține că trupele au reținut alți patru palestinieni și au confiscat arme.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an „Lupte intense” se dau în continuare în Khan Younis Armata israeliană a anunțat miercuri că „bătălii intense” se adau în continuare în Khan Younis, în sudul Fâșiei Gaza, unde afirmă că a localizat ceea ce a descris drept „puț de tunel” într-o școală. „În Khan Younis, luptele intense împotriva agenților teroriști continuă. Trupele terestre ale armatei au identificat un terorist care a încercat să planteze un dispozitiv exploziv pe un tanc și au direcționat o aeronavă să-l lovească pe acesta și pe alți trei teroriști în zonă. Mai mult, în Khan Younis, un avion de luptă al armatei a lovit un complex de unde se producerea arme pentru Jihadul Islamic”, a anunțat armata. „În timpul perchezițiilor într-o școală, trupele au localizat un puț de tunel și fotografii cu arme”, mai precizează armata. În Daraj Tuffah, trupele terestre israeliene au identificat o celulă teroristă care opera dronele folosite pentru a observa forțele israeliane în zonă.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Rebelii Houthi au lansat rachete balistice în Marea Roșie Rebelii Houthi din Yemen au tras două rachete balistice antinavă în sudul Mării Roșii marți seară, a anunțat miercuri Comandamentul Central al Statelor Unite (CENTCOM). Nu au fost raportate pagube în urma incidentului care marchează cel mai recent din zeci de atacuri Houthi asupra navelor comerciale. Rebelii spun că sunt solidari cu Hamas pe fondul războiului grupării palestiniene cu Israelul. „Mai multe nave comerciale din zonă au raportat impactul ASBM-urilor în apa înconjurătoare, deși niciuna nu a raportat vreo pagubă”, a spus CENTCOM, adăugând că atacurile au pus în pericol viața marinarilor nevinovați și au continuat să „perturbe fluxul liber al comerțului internațional. ” Ultimele atacuri Houthi vin după ce gruparea susținută de Iran a condamnat uciderea liderului de rang înalt al Hamas, Saleh Al-Arouri, într-un atac cu drone de marți în Liban, marți, numind-o „crimă lașă”.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Oficiali din Liban cer Hezbollah să nu răspundă atacului din Beirut Ministrul de Externe libanez, Abdallah Bou Habib, a declarat marți seară pentru BBC Radio 4 că guvernul său este în dialog cu Hezbollah pentru a „a-i convinge că nu ar trebui să răspundă singuri”. Cu toate acestea, a recunoscut că nu pot impune o decizie grupării. „Nu le spunem (nr. ce să facă), dialogăm cu ei în această privință”. În următoarele 24 de ore, va deveni clar „dacă răspund sau nu”, a continuat el. „Suntem foarte îngrijorați, [libanezii] nu vor să fie târâți în război, nici măcar Hezbollah nu vrea să fie târât într-un război regional”. Oficialul de la Beirut a cerut Occidentului „să facă presiuni asupra Israelului să oprească toate violențele și toate acțiunile sale, nu numai asupra Libanului, nu numai asupra Beirutului, ci și în Gaza”. Prim-ministrul israelian Benjamin Netanyahu a promis anterior că îi va elimina pe liderii Hamas, oriunde s-ar afla.\n\n3 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Crește riscul escaladării conflictului după asasinarea unui lider Hamas Liderul Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah a avertizat Israelul că dacă va mai comite asasinate pe teritoriul libanez se va confrunta cu o „reacție severă”, după ce marți Saleh Al-Arouri, liderul adjunct al Hamas, a fost ucis în Beirut de un atac cu dronă, relatează Reuters. Arouri, în vârstă de 57 de ani, a fost primul lider politic de rang înalt al Hamas care a fost asasinat de când Israelul a lansat o ofensivă aeriană și terestră împotriva grupării palestineni, în urmă cu aproape trei luni, după atacul Hamas asupra Israel din 7 octombrie. El era principala legătură a organizației cu Iranul și miliția Hezbollah din Liban. Arouri a fost influent și în Cisiordania, unde s-a născut și unde violența a crescut vertiginos în ultimele luni. Hezbollah a anunțat marți că a tras rachete un grup de soldați israelieni din vecinătatea localității Marj, în urma uciderii lui Arouri. Nasser Kanaani, purtătorul de cuvânt al Ministerului de Externe al Iranului, un susținător major al Hamas și Hezbollah, a declarat că uciderea lui Arouri va „aprinde, fără îndoială, un alt val în venele rezistenței și a motivației de a lupta împotriva ocupanților sionisti, nu numai în Palestina, ci și în regiune și printre toți cei care caută libertatea din întreaga lume”. Sute de palestinieni au ieșit pe străzile din Ramallah și din alte orașe din Cisiordania pentru a condamna uciderea lui Arouri, scandând: „Răzbunare, răzbunare, Qassam!” Israelul nu a confirmat și nici nu a infirmat că se află în spatele atacului care l-a ucis pe Arouri, dar purtătorul de cuvânt al armatei, contraamiralul Daniel Hagari, a declarat că forțele israeliene sunt pregătite pentru orice scenariu.\n\n2 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Blinken amână vizita în Israel pentru săptămâna viitoare Secretarul de stat american Antony Blinken și-a amânat călătoria în Israel pentru săptămâna viitoare, a declarat pentru The Times of Israel un oficial familiarizat cu această chestiune. Blinken trebuia să ajungă în Israel spre sfârșitul săptămânii, dar acum va sosi la începutul săptămânii viitoare, spune oficialul. Secretarul de stat va face câteva opriri în întreaga regiune. Întârzierea nu are nicio legătură cu moartea liderului adjunct al Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri.\n\n2 ian. 2024 - Acum un an Saleh al-Arouri a fost ucis de armata israeliană, anunţă un oficial american din domeniul apărării Un oficial american din domeniul apărării a declarat pentru The Washington Post că Israelul este responsabil pentru atacul aerian de lângă Beirut care l-a ucis pe adjunctul liderului Hamas Saleh al-Arouri, relatează The Times of Israel. Israelul nu a comentat încă în mod oficial atacul. Gruparea Hamas a confirmat asasinarea lui Saleh al-Arouri. „Asasinatele lașe comise de ocupația sionistă împotriva liderilor și simbolurilor poporului nostru palestinian în interiorul și în afara Palestinei nu vor reuși să frângă voința și fermitatea poporului nostru sau să submineze continuarea rezistenței sale curajoase”, afirmă Izzat al-Rishq, un înalt oficial Hamas, într-un comunicat. Acesta susţine că lovitura „dovedește încă o dată eșecul abject al inamicului de a atinge oricare dintre obiectivele sale agresive în Fâșia Gaza”. Prim-ministrul interimar al Libanului, Najib Mikati, a condamnat „noua crimă israeliană” și avertizează că Ierusalimul urmărește să antreneze Libanul într-o nouă fază de confruntări."

                "text": "KYODO NEWS - Jan 14, 2024 - 01:44 | World, All\n\nTaiwan's Vice President Lai Ching-te, who heads the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, declared victory in Saturday's presidential election and vowed to protect the self-ruled island from the growing threat posed by mainland China.\n\nIn the race closely watched by the world amid China's unrelenting pressure on Taiwan, Lai's victory means the DPP has secured a third consecutive four-year term, an unprecedented run of success in the period since the direct leadership poll was introduced in 1996.\n\nThe election commission said voter turnout was 71.9 percent. Lai secured 40.1 percent of votes and Hou Yu-ih of the main opposition Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, won 33.5 percent, according to final results released by the commission. Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People's Party, the second-largest opposition force, got 26.5 percent.\n\n\"As president, I have an important responsibility to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,\" Lai, 64, told his supporters in Taipei. \"We are also determined to safeguard Taiwan from continuing threats and intimidation from China.\"\n\nCommunist-led China, which aims to bring the island into its fold, by force if necessary, has slammed Lai as an independence advocate and a \"troublemaker.\" The two sides have been governed separately since they split in 1949 due to a civil war.\n\nChina said late Saturday that Lai's victory will not stop \"the inevitable trend\" of the unification between the mainland and Taiwan.\n\n\"Our stance on resolving the Taiwan question and realizing national reunification remains consistent, and our determination is as firm as rock,\" Chen Binhua, a spokesman for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said in a statement carried by the official Xinhua News Agency.\n\nLai also said Taiwan \"will stand on the side of democracy,\" noting that the Taiwanese people have successfully resisted election interference by external forces, namely China. \"We trust that only the people of Taiwan have the right to choose their own president,\" he said.\n\nThe vice president, who will be inaugurated on May 20, pledged to inherit President Tsai Ing-wen's foreign affairs and defense policies and called on Beijing, which has shunned talks with the DPP government since Tsai took office in 2016, to work toward peace that will benefit both sides of the Taiwan Strait.\n\n\"Under the principles of dignity and parity, we will use exchanges to replace obstructionism, dialogue to replace confrontation, and confidently pursue exchanges and cooperation with China,\" Lai said.\n\nHou, 66, apologized to his supporters at a rally in New Taipei for failing to bring about a change of government, saying, \"I let everybody down...I'm sorry to everyone.\"\n\nKo, a 64-year-old former Taipei mayor, also conceded defeat and thanked his supporters for showing to the world that Taiwan has not only the two major parties of the DPP and KMT but also his own party.\n\n\"Most importantly, we have demonstrated to the world that democracy has always been the most important asset of Taiwan,\" Ko said in New Taipei.\n\nAll three candidates had called for maintaining the status quo in the Taiwan Strait if elected, seeking neither the island's independence nor its unification with mainland China. Hou and Ko both sought dialogue with Beijing during the campaign.\n\nJapan congratulated Lai on his victory, with Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa saying in a statement that Tokyo will \"work toward further deepening cooperation and exchanges\" with Taipei.\n\n\"We expect that the issues surrounding Taiwan will be resolved peacefully by dialogue, thereby contributing to the peace and stability in the region,\" she said.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also congratulated Lai and expressed Washington's commitment to maintaining cross-strait peace and stability and the peaceful resolution of differences, free from coercion and pressure.\n\n\"The partnership between the American people and the people on Taiwan, rooted in democratic values, continues to broaden and deepen across economic, cultural, and people-to-people ties,\" he said.\n\nIn the legislative election, where 113 seats were up for grabs, the DPP failed to hold on to a majority, with the number of its seats declining from 62 to 51. Lai said the result meant \"we did not work hard enough and there are areas where we must humbly review and look back on.\"\n\nThe KMT secured the most seats at 52, 15 more than before, but still falling short of a majority, according to the official election results. The TPP won eight seats, up by three, and is forecast to hold the balance of power.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nTaiwan presidential hopeful Lai vows to keep cross-strait status quo\n\nTaiwan pres. election frontrunner Lai stresses maintaining status quo\n\nFOCUS: Taiwan poll may not affect Sino-U.S. ties, invasion unlikely in 2024"

                "text": "TAIPEI: An olive branch extended to the opposition and also to China – that was what Taiwan's newly elected leader William Lai Ching-te did in his first remarks after securing the presidency for the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Saturday (Jan 13).\n\nIn his victory speech delivered at a press conference at 8.30pm, he said: \"Under the principles of dignity and parity, we will use exchanges to replace obstructionism, dialogue to replace confrontation, and confidently pursue exchanges and cooperation with China.\n\n\"This furthers the wellbeing of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and achieves our objective of peace and common prosperity.\"\n\nMr Lai won 40.05 per cent of the vote, comfortably ahead of the Kuomintang's (KMT) Mr Hou Yu-ih with 33.49 per cent and the Taiwan People's Party's (TPP) Dr Ko Wen-je with 26.46 per cent, according to the Central Election Commission.\n\nMr Lai, the former mayor of Tainan, is a noted proponent of Taiwan’s independence. His rivals and critics have said his election would endanger Taiwan and threaten peace with China.\n\nBut his win was not a surprise, given that the vice-president, 64, had led in opinion polls months before Polling Day.\n\nHis rivals conceded defeat a mere four hours after voting closed, but Mr Lai could face an uphill battle ahead with the DPP losing its legislative majority.\n\nThe KMT secured the most legislative seats – 52 out of 113 – but fell short of a majority. The DPP won 51 seats and the TPP won eight seats. Two seats were won by independent candidates.\n\nThis means that while the DPP’s win marks the first time a party has won a third consecutive term since direct presidential elections began in Taiwan in 1996, Mr Lai will have to govern with a hung parliament that could make it more difficult to push through new laws.\n\nHe said he had accepted his rivals’ congratulatory phone calls, and in turn congratulated them for increasing their seats in the legislature."

                "text": "The 64-year-old chairperson of the ruling DPP has named Hsiao Bi-khim, 52, who until November last year was Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the US, as his running mate.\n\nIn the debate, Lai reiterated that he would follow Tsai’s path on the relationship with mainland China and maintain the status quo, protecting Taiwan and keeping the peace in the Indo-Pacific.\n\n“The world is watching Taiwanese people’s choice between democracy and autocracy; the international community knows very well that only Lai Ching-te and Hsiao Bi-khim could stand shoulder-to-shoulder and walk with democratic allies,” he said in Mandarin.\n\nLai, who began his political career as a legislator and later became mayor of the southern city of Tainan, described himself as a “pragmatic worker for Taiwan independence” when he served as Tsai’s premier between 2017 and 2019. He added that “Taiwan is already an independent sovereign nation called the Republic of China…there is no need to further declare Taiwan independence.”\n\nLai’s stance drew criticism from both China and his opposition. In November, Beijing called Lai and Hsiao the “independence duo” who would endanger peace across the strait. Lai’s rivals, Hou and Ko, also took aim at his position on Beijing-Taipei issues. “The sovereignty of Taiwan belongs to the 23 million Taiwanese people, not to [China],” Lai said in response to a question from Ko. “The Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China are not subordinate to one another, that’s the meaning of Taiwan independence.”\n\nLai’s political platform includes plans for more subsidised housing as well as increasing wages and reducing taxes.\n\nHou Yu-ih (KMT)\n\nFormerly the director general of the National Police Agency, Hou gained attention when he was re-elected in 2022 as mayor of the northern New Taipei City which surrounds the capital, beating his DPP rival by a landslide. That year, the KMT trounced the ruling DPP in local elections, leading to Tsai’s resignation as party head.\n\nThe 66-year-old has tailed Lai closely in most recent polls. He has named Jaw Shaw-kong, 73, a former KMT lawmaker and a media personality, as his running mate.\n\nHou, who originally joined the KMT in the 1970s under the dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek, indicated that he opposed Taiwan independence and One Country, Two Systems, a governing framework that China imposed on Hong Kong and Macau, touting it as a way for Taiwan to achieve unification.\n\n“No Taiwan independence, no One Country, Two Systems,” Hou said during the televised debate. “Steadfastly defend freedom and the democratic system. Taiwan’s future is decided by its 23 million residents.”\n\nBut Hou was challenged by his rivals over his – and the KMT’s – position on having warmer ties with China despite Beijing’s increasing bellicosity. Hou fended off the criticism by stressing that he was only pushing to restore cross-strait dialogue, which Beijing had halted with Tsai’s administration.\n\nHou has expressed his support for the 1992 consensus – a tacit agreement between Beijing and the KMT that both Taipei and Beijing are part of a single China, although each can have its own interpretation.\n\nTsai, however, has rejected the concept, saying in response to a speech by China’s leader Xi Jinping back in 2019, that “we have never accepted the 1992 consensus.” Hou insisted that cross-strait communication based on the 1992 consensus was the only way to mitigate the risks of a war, but also said Taiwan must strengthen its military capacity to deter a possible invasion by China.\n\nDomestically, Hou has proposed stepping up government subsidies for youth with regard to higher education and housing.\n\nKo Wen-je (TPP)\n\nThe former mayor of Taipei City who founded the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) in 2019, Ko has branded himself as a “third force,” appealing to voters unhappy with both the DPP and the KMT. He has teamed up with Cynthia Wu Hsin-ying, 45, a TPP legislator and the daughter of a Taiwanese billionaire, to run in the election.\n\nThe 64-year-old worked as a surgeon for three decades before serving as mayor of the capital between 2014 and 2022. While Ko previously supported the DPP’s presidential campaign – including Tsai’s – he has moved away from the ruling party in recent years, accusing it of escalating cross-strait tensions and failing to solve bread-and-butter domestic issues.\n\nDuring the debate, Ko said that the long-term domination of Taiwanese politics by the DPP and KMT had culminated in “fractures across races, communities, and the nation.” He vowed to bring about “social harmony, political reconciliation, and cross-strait peace” for Taiwan.\n\nHowever, he came under attack – mainly by Lai – for expressing in 2015 that “both sides of the strait are one family.” Ko defended himself by saying that it was only a “friendly gesture,” and interactions across the strait must be based on the premise that “Taiwan’s democratic system and way of life are protected,” adding that there was no alternative for Taiwan other than “maintaining the status quo.” He said the self-ruled island must find its own position and not be a pawn in US-China rivalry.\n\nIn November, the opposition candidates attempted to form an alliance to increase their chances against Lai, but negotiations collapsed on live television as Hou and Ko could not agree on who should top the joint ticket.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Ko has honed in on social welfare policies to address the high cost of housing, low wages, and the burden of elderly care. Despite trailing in the polls, Ko has attracted young people to his rallies and garnered a huge following on his social media accounts.\n\nThe Legislative Yuan\n\nOn January 13, voters will also cast their ballots for all 113 seats of the island’s parliament. According to election rules, 73 legislators are “district-based,” elected first-past-the-post in constituencies based on geographical districts.\n\nAnother 34 seats are elected by political party-list on a second ballot, which will determine how many seats each party gets under a proportional representation system based on nationwide votes. The election rules also require that, for each party, at least half of the legislators elected on the ballot must be female.\n\nThe remaining six seats are chosen by Indigenous people who account for 2.5 percent of the island’s population, according to official figures.\n\nThe Central Election Commission says that 34.5 percent of the candidates vying for a seat on the “district-based” and Indigenous ballots are female — the highest since 2008, when the current electoral system was introduced.\n\nPolls show that no single party is likely to obtain a majority, meaning that whoever wins the presidential election will still have to seek a political coalition in parliament."

Sign up now!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn just one week, the hotly anticipated presidential and legislative elections in Taiwan will be finished, and the choice of the self-ruled island’s voters will finally be known.\n\nCandidates of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Beijing-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) are vying for the top job, following years of strained cross-strait relations since Tsai Ing-wen of the independence-leaning DPP was first elected president in 2016. Voters will also be electing a new legislative body.\n\nThe stakes are particularly high, as the crucial election on January 13 is poised to shape cross-strait relations as well as bilateral ties between mainland China and the United States.\n\nThe DPP candidate, Vice-President William Lai Ching-te, is currently ahead in the polls, ahead of KMT’s Hou Yu-ih and TPP’s Ko Wen-je. The KMT, though, has a slight lead in the polls for the 133 legislative seats.\n\n05:27 Taiwan election exposes generational rift over potential reunification with mainland China Taiwan election exposes generational rift over potential reunification with mainland China\n\nIn the lead-up to the widely watched election, presidential candidates have been scrambling to assure voters that they are the best choice to achieve cross-strait peace. Tensions have been high as Beijing has stepped up military, political and economic pressure on the self-ruled island, particularly over the past year."

                "text": "Hey there, time traveller!\n\nThis article was published 06/01/2024 (424 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.\n\nHOUSTON (AP) — Many of the Washington Huskies feel a connection to the 1991 team that won the school’s only national title with players from that squad visiting with them and sharing stories of their run.\n\nBut as these Huskies prepare to compete for the championship again Monday night against Michigan, there’s one player who shares the ultimate bond with someone from that team.\n\nSenior linebacker Carson Bruener’s father, Mark Bruener, was a freshman tight end on the 1991 team that went 12-0 to win the national championship.\n\nWashington head coach Kalen DeBoer participates during media day ahead of the national championship NCAA College Football Playoff game between Washington and Michigan Saturday, Jan. 6, 2024, in Houston. The game will be played Monday. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)\n\n“It’s awesome,” Carson Bruener said. “We’ve talked about it all year. It’s cool to just be able to compare and contrast and get his point of view on what’s it like be in the national championship. I feel like it just gives me that extra motivation.”\n\nWashington star defensive end Bralen Trice said the current Huskies are well educated about and by that 1991 team.\n\n“We’ve gone over the history of the ’91 team, we know everything about them. It’s awesome to be surrounded by support from them,” Trice said.\n\nTrice talked about particularly admiring former Huskies linebacker Dave Hoffman, who had a brief NFL career before becoming a member of the Secret Service, protecting presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.\n\n“That dude is like a hammer,” Trice said. “Just seeing clips, hearing from him in the past.”\n\nThe elder Bruener has given his son plenty of advice in the days leading up to the game. But what stuck with him most is to remember that this could be his only chance to compete for a championship. After winning the national title as a freshman, Mark Bruener also started his NFL career with a trip to the Super Bowl with the Steelers. Pittsburgh lost that game to the Colts and Mark Bruener never reached the big game again in a 14-year career.\n\n“So, really just soaking in the moment because it could be a once in a lifetime opportunity,” Carson Bruener said. “Obviously our plan and our goal is to do this every single year, but you’ve really just got to live in the moment.”\n\nCONNECTED\n\nMichigan running backs coach Mike Hart might be as close to some members of Washington’s coaching staff as he is to the guys working for the Wolverines.\n\nHart considers Washington tight ends coach Nick Sheridan his best friend after the two played together at Michigan and were both assistants at Indiana together. He’s also worked with Washington coach Kalen DeBoer at both Eastern Michigan and Indiana and spent time alongside Washington offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb at Eastern Michigan.\n\nHart coached with Washington linebackers coach William Inge at Indiana and he recruited Huskies graduate assistant Shaq Vann.\n\n“I know a lot of the guys there and not just know them, but I have some really good friends there,” Hart said. “We really enjoy being around each other. Wouldn’t be happier playing anybody else than these guys in the national championship.”\n\nHart, who is Michigan’s all-time leading rusher, also has another connection to DeBoer that happened before the two coached together at Indiana.\n\n“My youngest daughter is named Kalen, but not after him though,” Hart said. “We didn’t know if we were going to have a boy or a girl and my wife wanted a name that went both ways. And I said ‘Kalen.’ And she’s like: ‘there’s no boys named Kalen.’ And I had to show her a picture of DeBoer.”\n\nHEY, OLD FRIEND\n\nGiles Jackson will suit up for Washington on Monday, but the receiver is plenty familiar to the Wolverines after beginning his career at Michigan.\n\nJackson spent two years in Ann Arbor before transferring to Washington for the 2021 season. He had three catches for 49 yards and three runs for 9 yards in Washington’s 31-10 loss at Michigan that year.\n\n“It’s a fun week,” Jackson said. “It’s a surreal moment, honestly seeing both teams I’ve played for being in the College Football Championship.”\n\nJackson hasn’t kept in touch with a lot of his former teammates, but he has talked to Michigan receiver Cornelius Johnson a bit.\n\nBut Johnson said they won’t be interacting this week.\n\n“It’s serious because they are the opponent now,” Johnson said. “Until then, I’m not friends with him until after the game. That’s the mindset.”\n\nHUSKY HEX\n\nMichigan offensive tackle LaDarius Henderson was part of the last team to beat Washington.\n\nThe Huskies’ 21-game winning streak dates back to last season, when they lost 45-38 at Arizona State.\n\nHenderson was the starting left guard for the Sun Devils, but suffered a tendon injury in his hand during that game and missed the rest of the season.\n\nStill, it was a happy memory.\n\n“We had our former walk-on quarterback starting, Trenton Bourguet. And he diced them up. That game was awesome,” Henderson said. “I’m 2-0 against these Huskies.”\n\nHenderson has played left tackle for Michigan, helping solidify one of the best lines in the country.\n\nHe had no ties to Michigan when he transferred in. He said he just wanted to challenge himself, raise his profile and play in big games.\n\n“Why not come to Michigan?” he said. “Let’s bet on myself, roll the dice and let’s see it.”\n\n___\n\nAP College Football writers Ralph D.

                "date": "20240107T170000Z",
                "text": "HOUSTON -- A 10-year-old golden retriever named Ben roamed around the George R. Brown Convention Center during the college football national championship media day on Saturday like he owned the place. Without a leash or even a collar, the fluffy, white-faced pup didn’t meet a writer he didn’t like.\n\nOh, and his owner knows a thing or two about Monday’s national championship matchup between Michigan and Washington.\n\nKirk Herbstreit, the long-time ESPN analyst, will serve as the color commentator for the game, just as he did for Michigan’s Rose Bowl win over Alabama. He’s already called four Washington games this season. Monday pits the top two teams in the sport against each other, two 14-0 teams with contrasting styles that took different paths to Houston.\n\nHerbstreit offered his two most important keys to the game. When the Wolverines have the ball, can they establish a consistent running game? It hasn’t been a problem all season, and it helps set up Michigan’s play-action pass game. “That will be big -- the battle up front,” Herbstreit said.\n\nThe million-dollar question for Michigan’s defense: “Can they pressure (Michael) Penix? We know about his accuracy and all those great receivers. How much time he has to distribute the football will be huge,” Herbstreit said.\n\nPlayers and coaches on both sides agree, especially with the second point. Washington’s offensive line was voted the best in the country. Michigan’s defensive line and entire defense has been exceptional all season, including against Alabama.\n\nHerbstreit -- who will work alongside Chris Fowler in the booth, with Holly Rowe and Molly McGrath on the sidelines -- isn’t sure Michigan has played to its full potential this season, a scary thought for Monday.\n\n“They’re as good as we’ve seen this year playing complementary football,” he said. He referenced the Penn State game, when Michigan didn’t throw a pass in the second half and instead leaned on Blake Corum and its defense, and other instances where quarterback J.J. McCarthy was given more freedom. “Their style adjusts to the circumstances they face that week.”\n\nLike any great team, the Wolverines have taken on the personality of their coach. Herbstreit recalled Josh Gattis’ time as offensive coordinator (2019 to 2021), when Michigan went to a spread team that attacked on the perimeter. It didn’t look like a Jim Harbaugh team, especially on the offensive line.\n\n“Now I see an identity,” Herbstreit said, and that’s an “old-school” offense.\n\nBefore this season, Michigan had lost in the playoff semifinals two years in a row. In 2021, Herbstreit believes the Wolverines were gassed after beating Ohio State, and overmatched by Georgia in Miami. He conceded they should have beaten TCU in last year’s Fiesta Bowl.\n\n“This year, with all the noise -- What’s going on with Harbaugh? What’s going on with the sign-stealing stuff? -- these players…there has been a singular focus on winning the national championship.”\n\nAs the big wins piled up late in the season -- Ohio State again, Iowa in the Big Ten championship, and then Alabama -- the Wolverines stayed hungry. “The first thing Corum said on the dais after the Rose Bowl was, ‘We’ve got unfinished business,’” Herbstreit said. “There’s an energy driving this team that is very special.”\n\nIs it enough to get past Washington? Herbstreit, citing some unwritten rule that someone calling the game can’t predict the outcome, abstained from an actual prediction -- perhaps because he couldnt’t decide.\n\nHe’s thoroughly impressed with Michigan. He admires how Washington has responded to skeptics all season.\n\n“I don’t give either team an edge,” he said. “I think it’s a game of momentum swings back and forth. I think it’s like a 31-27 type of game. But I don’t know who’s going to win it.”\n\nThough one would think Ben would prefer the team with the canine mascot, he didn’t offer a prediction either."

From flights to game tickets to lodging, the compressed timeline has travel costs soaring for Wolverine fans traveling from Michigan, .\n\nNon-stop flights leaving from Detroit on Sunday, Jan. 7, have pretty exorbitant prices at this time. A flight on United is more than $1,300, while a flight on Delta is about $2,300.\n\nA more affordable option is a flight on Spirit Airlines for more than $530, though that comes with a stop.

It will be the No. 1 Michigan Wolverines vs. the No. 2 Washington Huskies in Houston on Monday night for the right to crown a champion. Although the two other playoff teams will be playing in the SEC next year, neither the Alabama Crimson Tide or the Texas Longhorns got it done in their semifinals.\n\nWith the Pac-12 dying after this season, the Power Five will become the Power Four with the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12 and SEC all almost certainly getting the four first-round byes as conference champions in the next College Football Playoff. Yes, there will be deserving conference winners out of the Group of Five, but this is the final title bout from the old way of doing things in college football as we know it.\n\nThe funny part about this national championship game matchup between Michigan and Washington is that it will be a conference game this time next season. This is because Washington is one of four Pac-12 schools joining the Big Ten next year, alongside the Oregon Ducks, the UCLA Bruins and the USC Trojans. We cannot wait to see UCLA play Rutgers in Piscataway to completely break our brains.\n\nBut before your brain is completely rendered useless, when was the last time a college football national championship game did not feature an SEC team? Fate would have it, it's the other book end.\n\nWhen was the last national championship game that lacked an SEC team?\n\nThis will be the final four-team College Football Playoff. It expands to 12 teams next season for year No. 11, so to speak. From the 2015 college season to the 2022 one, the national championship game featured at least one of these three SEC teams (Alabama, Georgia, LSU) or ACC power Clemson, sometimes two of the four. This means the last national title without an SEC team was back in 2014.\n\nThe first-ever College Football Playoff National Championship saw the No. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes out of the Big Ten defeat the No. 2 Oregon Ducks. This was Urban Meyer's last national championship victory, as well as the beginning of the end for Mark Helfrich riding Chip Kelly's coattails in Eugene. Ohio State had defeated Nick Saban's Alabama Crimson Tide in the Sugar Bowl as the No. 4 seed.\n\nSince 2015, Alabama has played in six national championships (2015-18, 2020-21), winning three of them (2015, 2017, 2020). Georgia has played in three national championships (2017, 2021-22), winning two (2021-22). LSU won the College Football Playoff the only year it qualified (2019). Clemson has played in four national championships (2015-16, 2018-19), winning a pair (2016, 2018).\n\nAlthough Michigan and Washington have made the playoff before, this is the first time either the Wolverines or the Huskies won a national semifinal game. Michigan had been 0-2 prior to this season, while Washington lost its only national semifinal game prior to this season back in 2016. A win on Monday would give Michigan its first national title since 1997. For Washington, its first since 1991.\n\nEven though the southeast does not have a team in the title bout, everyone will be watching Monday."

Trump for abuse of power under the theory that he attempted to use a foreign leader—Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky—to benefit his 2020 presidential campaign, despite a lack of any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of President Trump.”\n\nNow the review is on whether the Biden-Harris regime committed a similar “offense” by “using taxpayer dollars to transport a foreign leader for political gain.”\n\nComer wrote, “The committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power.”\n\nThe report confirmed Zelensky’s stops including meetings with high-profile Democrats and during an interview made comments “critical” of the GOP ticket of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe investigation could result in a determination of ethics violations, or criminal counts.\n\nComer wondered, “The committee seeks to understand the circumstances that led and any facts that could justify the Biden-Harris administration to transport President Zelensky on a Department of the Air Force aircraft to Pennsylvania.”\n\nAccording to Fox News, the scandal involving Zelensky allowed him to “interfere” in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd the report noted Congress cited the description of the Pennsylvania vote as the “trickiest battleground for Vice President Kamala Harris to win.”"

                "text": "Analysis by WorldTribune Staff, August 19, 2024 Contract With Our Readers\n\n\n\nThe House Oversight, Ways and Means, and Judiciary Committees on Monday released a report which charged that Joe Biden committed “impeachable offenses” by helping his family rake in millions of dollars in business schemes that traded on his name.\n\nThe committees’ investigation found Hunter Biden and other family members received over $27 million from foreign sources. These funds were often obscured in “shell companies” to hide their true origins, the committees said. Some of the funds sent from China, for example, ended up directly in Joe Biden’s bank account.\n\nThe 291-page report concluded that Biden “conspired to commit influence peddling and grift. In doing so, he abused his office and, by repeatedly lying about his abuse of office, has defrauded the United States to enrich his family.”\n\nBut what accountability will result from the Republicans’ nine-month investigation at taxpayer expense?\n\nAs usual, with Republican “investigations,” the answer is most likely none.\n\nSupport American Journalism\n\nThe 81-year-old Biden has just months left in his term and is obviously not going to be impeached or go to jail.\n\nThe Gateway Pundit called it last year, writing on July 23, 2023:\n\nSo what now? What will Republicans do next? How will this end? Democrats are moving to jail President Trump on illegitimate charges in garbage court cases. Where are the Republicans? We all know the answer to this. Before Joe Biden is impeached he will have a slip, a fall, or a medical emergency. His administration will tearfully announce Joe is stepping down from office. Democrats and their lapdog media will then insist the Biden Crime Story is “yesterday’s news” and “has already been prosecuted.” The American public will be lectured on what a great leader Joe Biden was and how he should be forever honored in our memories and the history books. Republican leadership and Uniparty members will breathe a sigh of relief that they will not be forced to go through impeachment proceedings. They will tell us, “This is not who we are.”\n\nThe report released by the committees on Monday cited evidence that Biden “actively participated” in an influence-peddling conspiracy by attending dinners with his family’s foreign associates and speaking to them over the phone. These interactions were documented by email evidence and testimony from several of Hunter Biden’s ex-business partners, including Devon Archer and Jason Galanis.\n\nThe committees also said evidence shows Hunter Biden used his father’s official position as vice president to “garner favorable outcomes in foreign business dealings and legal proceedings.”\n\n“First and foremost, overwhelming evidence demonstrates that President Biden participated in a conspiracy to monetize his office of public trust to enrich his family,” the committee’s concluded in the the report released the day Biden was to be honored at the opening of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\n“Among other aspects of this conspiracy, the Biden family and their business associates received tens of millions of dollars from foreign interests by leading those interests to believe that such payments would provide them access to and influence with President Biden,” the executive summary added.\n\nHelp Wanted"

                "text": "The public is exhausted after a decade of chronic untruth from the left-wing and its media.\n\nThe 2016 presidential campaign will be long remembered for the false allegation that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to warp the election.\n\nCiting the bogus “Steele dossier,” loser Hillary Clinton and other Democrat grandees claimed that the victorious Trump was an “illegitimate” president.\n\nAlmost immediately, the left and media then pushed for the appointment of special prosecutor Robert Mueller. He assembled a “dream team” of partisan prosecutors to prove Trump-Russian collusion.\n\nSome 22 months later, Mueller found no evidence that Trump improperly won the 2016 election with help from any colluding Russians.\n\nMore hysteria followed when Trump was impeached in December 2019.\n\nThe left claimed he had pressured the Ukrainian government to look into the family of Joe Biden (then a potential 2020 election opponent) for its corruption with Ukrainian oligarchs — as a condition for releasing military aid designated to Kyiv.\n\nYet Hunter Biden was paid nearly $1 million a year by a Ukrainian energy company to enlist his father, Vice President Joe Biden, for quid pro quo services.\n\nIn turn, Joe Biden himself later bragged he had pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor, Victor Shokin — who happened to be looking too closely into the various shady schemes of the Biden family.\n\nThe deceptions and lies continued.\n\nOn the eve of the first 2020 debate, Biden aide and now Secretary of State Antony Blinken helped to round up “51 former intelligence authorities” to claim falsely that Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop — full of incriminating evidence of felonious Biden family behavior — was fabricated by the Russians.\n\nYet the FBI already had the laptop and had authenticated it as genuine.\n\nThe FBI was also actively enlisting Silicon Valley social media companies to suppress accurate news accounts of the laptop’s embarrassing contents — ostensibly to aid the Biden campaign.\n\nThe signees of the false letter included former intelligence kingpins such as Leon Panetta, James Clapper, and John Brennan. None has ever apologized for deliberating lying to the country in a (successful) attempt to help alter an election.\n\nDuring the summer of 2021, top military officials, at least publicly, parroted the Biden administration’s lie that it was safe to abruptly withdraw all troops from Afghanistan.\n\nThe Biden plan was to take political credit for ending the two-decade-long war on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 and the American invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nYet many intelligence officials in and outside the Pentagon had warned both Biden and the Pentagon top brass that any such reckless and total withdrawal would collapse Afghanistan.\n\nThey rightly also advised that sudden flight would give terrorists a windfall of equipment and infrastructure.\n\nBut they were ignored and during the subsequent Biden misadventure, 13 American Marines were needlessly killed.\n\nAfter the greatest military humiliation in a half-century, Biden and many in the media lied that the mission was nevertheless a successful withdrawal.\n\nBut that was not all. For the first time in history, a presidential candidate, Donald Trump, was subjected to numerous criminal and civil suits in an election year.\n\nYet an aide of the federal prosecutor, Jack Smith, met with Biden officials. A high-ranking Biden Justice federal attorney joined the New York municipal prosecution. The Georgia prosecutor met stealthily with Biden’s legal counsel. And a major Biden donor funded the civil suit.\n\nThe once collusion-hungry media ignored all such lawfare and rank collusion.\n\nDuring the 2020 Democratic primaries, the general election, and throughout the first three years of the Biden administration, it was evident that Joe Biden was physically and mentally incapable of serving as president.\n\nYet his aides and the media all misled the American people. They insisted that Biden was vigorous and sharp.\n\nThen suddenly in June 2024, within a 24-hour period, Biden was declared by these same insiders as unfit to continue as the Democratic nominee.\n\nTheir new problem with Biden was not just his long-standing embarrassing dementia. Rather bad polls increasingly warned that voters no longer believed their lies and thus would likely not reelect Biden but would instead punish most Democrats in the upcoming 2024 election.\n\nSo, a new media narrative arose: the once-hale Biden was forced to resign as the Democratic nominee. His once widely caricatured vice president, Kamala Harris, just as abruptly was coronated as his replacement candidate by an equally suddenly gushing and colluding media.\n\nIn sum, for some nine years, the media and the left have successfully fed the country a succession of rank deceptions and conspiracies.\n\nThey did so because they proclaimed Trump too dangerous to be president and therefore any means they employed to stop him were to be justified. And they are doing so yet a third time in 2024.\n\nAs they continue, they have all but destroyed democracy, ruined the reputation of the media, alienated the public — and embarrassed their country before the world.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for American Greatness.

Se (Trump) vencer (...) estas eleições, vejam o que vai acontecer. É perigoso. É um perigo para a segurança dos Estados Unidos\", disse à emissora CBS News o presidente de 81 anos, que desistiu da candidatura à reeleição e passou o bastão para sua vice-presidente, Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Estamos em um ponto de inflexão na história mundial... E a democracia é a chave\", ressaltou Biden, que tem mantido um perfil discreto após sua saída da corrida eleitoral, depois que seu desempenho desastroso no primeiro debate televisionado contra Trump, em junho, gerou temores sobre sua idade e acuidade mental, o que provocou pedidos dos democratas para que se afastasse.\n\nNa curta entrevista à TV, gravada na Casa Branca na semana passada, Biden apareceu com semblante frágil, mas coerente, admitindo novamente que fracassou no debate, embora tenha enfatizado que em termos de saúde não sofra de \"nenhum problema sério\".\n\nAo explicar sua desistência, disse que outros políticos do Partido Democrata temiam que suas chances se complicassem e acrescentou que sua única prioridade era evitar que Trump voltasse ao poder.\n\nTrês semanas após este debate, Biden anunciou, em 21 de julho, que não disputaria as eleições de 5 de novembro e que Kamala Harris ficaria em seu lugar.\n\n\"Uma questão crítica para mim continua sendo - e não é brincadeira - manter esta democracia\", sentenciou Biden."

It accuses President Biden and his son Hunter of selling influence.\n\nThe report said Biden’s family and associates made $27 million in exchange.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There’s a huge cloud over the President of the United States,” said Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), one of the members of the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThe committee report said President Biden met with or was on the phone with Hunter Biden while he was meeting with foreign business associates. One committee witness said, “Hunter Biden put his dad on speaker phone when he was interacting with business associate ‘maybe 20 times,’” the report said.\n\nHouse Democrats released a dueling memo, arguing President Biden committed no wrongdoing.\n\n“To be clear, there is no evidence that Joe Biden ever discussed his son’s business ventures during any of these calls or visits,” the memo said. “The investigation has sought to weaponize the bond between President Biden and Hunter at a time when Joe Biden feared losing Hunter to drug addiction.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe House formally ratified the impeachment inquiry in December of 2023. The report recommends Biden’s impeachment and removal, though House Republicans have indicated it may not happen before the end of President Biden’s term.\n\n“I think it would not be in the best interest of our country to move forward on that,” said Sessions. “I will tell you that it is inconsequential now whether we move forward to remove President Biden or not. President Biden is a cooked President.”\n\nHunter Biden is set for trial on tax charges related to his foreign business deals next month.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

Early voting turnout is expected to increase during this final week of early voting.\n\nBy the end of the early voting period, Raffensperger’s office projects hitting just shy of four million early voters.\n\nThis past weekend was also the last set of optional Saturday voting in a state that will play a key role in electing either Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris the 47th president of the United States.\n\nTrump is running to reclaim the Oval Office he lost to Democrat Joe Biden four years ago. If Trump wins, he will become the first former president to reclaim the White House since 19th century Democrat Grover Cleveland after losing a bid for reelection, along with becoming the first formerly twice-impeached president and the first-ever convicted felon elected president.\n\nHarris is also seeking to make history by becoming the first woman and woman of color ever elected president.

                "text": "On Sunday, he acknowledged he might lose in November: “If she wins, it’s not going to be so pleasant for me, but I don’t care.”\n\nHis derision of the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket as “stupid,” “weak,” “dumb as a rock” and “lazy” is also a sign of how nasty and personal the final stretch of the campaign may be.\n\nHis allies have pushed him publicly and privately to talk instead about the economy, immigration and other issues.\n\n“I just think the better course to take is to prosecute the case that her policies are destroying the country,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday when asked about Trump’s comments. “They’re crazy liberal.”\n\nWhen asked whether he approved of the personal attacks on Harris, Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., sidestepped during an interview on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\n“I think Kamala Harris is the wrong choice for America,” said Emmer, who is helping Trump’s running mate JD Vance prepare for Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. “I think Kamala Harris is actually as bad or worse as the administration that we’ve witnessed for the last four years.”\n\nWhen pressed, Emmer said: “I think we should stick to the issues. The issues are, Donald Trump fixed it once. They broke it. He’s going to fix it again. Those are the issues.”\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, running for the Senate as a moderate Republican, brought up Trump’s false claims that Harris, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, had previously played down her Black heritage. Harris attended Howard University, a historically Black college, and has identified as both Black and South Asian consistently throughout her political career.\n\n“I’ve already called him out when he had the one interview where he was questioning her racial identity, and now he’s questioning her mental competence,” Hogan told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “And I think that’s insulting not only to the vice president but to people who actually do have mental disabilities.”\n\nHarris has not commented on Trump’s recent attacks but has said when asked about other comments that it was the “ same old show. The same tired playbook we’ve heard for years with no plan on on how he would address the needs of the American people.”\n\nAhead of the rally on Sunday, some of Trump’s supporters said he often makes offensive remarks. Still, they support his proposals to restrict immigration and said he would have a better handle on the economy.\n\n“He says what’s on his mind, and again, sometimes how he says it isn’t appropriate,” said Jeffrey Balogh, 56, who attended the rally with two friends. “But he did the job. He did very well at it.”\n\nTamara Molnar said she thinks Trump is very strong on immigration. As for his insults, Molnar said: “I think everybody has to have some decorum when speaking about other candidates, and I don’t think either side is necessarily innocent on that. There’s a lot of slinging both ways.”\n\nAt the rally in Erie, Trump said the “invasion” would end and deportations begin if he took office.\n\n“Thousands of migrants from the most dangerous countries are destroying the character of small towns and leaving local communities in anguish and in despair,” he said, talking about communities in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nLast month, the GOP leader said he was “entitled” to personal attacks against Harris.\n\n“As far as the personal attacks, I’m very angry at her because of what she’s done to the country,” he told a news conference then. “I’m very angry at her that she would weaponize the justice system against me and other people, very angry at her. I think I’m entitled to personal attacks.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed from New York."

If a Republican did what she did, that Republican would be impeached and removed from office, and rightfully so, for high crimes and misdemeanors,” he said during a speech in Prairie du Chien, Wis.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way. She was born that way. And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country,” he continued.\n\nTrump: Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way.

                "text": "Kamala Harris\n\n\n\nHarris is the first Black woman and first Asian American woman to contest in the US President race from a major political party.\n\nThough Harris grew up in Oakland and spent her career in California, her ancestry can be traced back to India's Tamil Nadu. She is the daughter of Shyamala Gopalan, a biologist and Donald J Harris, a Jamaican native. She has a sister Maya Lakshmi Harris.\n\nShe was the Attorney General of California from 2011 to 2017 and was the first African American, and the first South Asian American to hold the office.\n\nShe was the US Senator from 2017 to 2021 where she was hailed for her prosecutorial questioning style during hearings.\n\nHarris is married to Doug Emhoff, and his step mom to Cole and Ella.\n\nDonald Trump\n\n\n\nTrump does not believe in exercising and considers it as a waste of time and energy. He believes the human body is a battery with only a finite amount of energy and exercise depletes it faster.\n\nTrump's favorite movie is Citizen Kane. “I think you learn in Citizen Kane that maybe wealth isn’t everything. Because he had the wealth, but he didn’t have the happiness,” he said in a 2002 video interview.\n\nHe was the third president in US history to be impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives and the only president to be impeached twice-once in 2019 and once in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, he was defeated by Joe Biden by 306 votes.\n\nOn July 13, during a campaign rally in Butler Township, Pennsylvania Trump had a narrow escape from an assassination attempt where a bullet grazed his ear.\n\nThis year's Presidential race in the US is one of a kind as a former President contests with the sitting Vice President. The 2024 US Presidential election is slated to be held on November 5. The elected President and Vice President will hold the office for a term of 4 years.As the election campaign and debates intensify, let's learn about the top contenders in the race: Kamala Harris from the Democratic Party and Donald Trump from the Republican Party.Indian origin Kamala Devi Harris' nomination was an interesting one. She announced her candidacy after the current US President Joe Biden opted to end his campaign following controversy in a debate performance. Biden withdrew his candidature a few weeks after the campaign began and Kamala Harris was nominated on July 21. Here are a few interesting things to note:78 year old Donald Trump was the 45th US President and held the office from 2017 to 2021. An economics graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, Trump was into real estates, and was a reality television star before his political career began. Here are a few interesting things to note:Other candidates outside of the major parties who are contesting for the President post are Cornel West, Jill Stein and Chase Oliver. Tim Walz and JD Vance are running for Vice President position."
