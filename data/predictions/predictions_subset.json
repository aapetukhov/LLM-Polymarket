    "description": "In 2001, Michael Vick set the NFL record for yards per carry by a quarterback in a season at 9.3 yards.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Drake Maye of the New England Patriots records an average of 9.4 or more Yards per Carry during 2024-25 NFL Regular Season. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nNote: Vick's record is only considers QB seasons where the player played a minimum of 8 games, and averaged 3+ carries per game. This will have no effect on the resolution of this market: this market only relates to whether or not Drake Maye's season long average will be 9.4 or more yards per carry.\n\nThe resolution of this market will be official stats by the National Football League (see: https://www.nfl.com/players/drake-maye/stats/).
